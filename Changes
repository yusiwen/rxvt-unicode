1.9  Wed Feb 25 16:46:05 CET 2004
	- fixed bug in plain scrollbar causing X errors in XCreateGC.
        - implemented sharing of X connections. will be used to speed
          up many x operations considerably. Also saves some memory.
        - implemented caching of input methods. This immensely shortens
          startup time for new terms in rxvtd. At least XFree86 4.3 is
          rather broken with respect to input methods, though, so expect
          crashes when you kill your input method (xterm et al. also crash).
        - fix bugs in X flushing, causing an empty screen after startup.
        - fix various memleaks in rxvtd.
        - fix a bug that kept escape codes to be generated for some
          keysyms that also have string translations, when not --enable-xim.
          reported by joel reed.
        - re-enabled esc-seq. for font-switching (\033 ] 50 ; <fontset> \007).
        - re-enabled menubar (experimental!).
        - fix bug in locale-handling that kept the correct locale from
          being selected.
        - implemented esc-seq. to switch locales (\033 ] 9 ; <locale> \007).
        - removed greek support.
        - allow NUL bytes (ctrl-@) to be entered even with XIM enabled.
        - correct cursor width if !focus.
        - fixed --enable-xgetdefault, reported by eduard bloch.
        - added manpage for rxvtc/rxvtd based on the one eduard block
          contributed.
        - use reverse video for normal bold text unless colorBD has been set.
        - fixed endless loop when selection is valid but empty.
        - changed default terminal name to "rxvt".
        - many other minor bugfixes.

1.8  Mon Feb  2 20:09:18 CET 2004
	- almost total conversion to C++. Except for introducing
          new bugs, this should not change much.
        - fix and re-enable background pixmap and inherit pixmap support.
        - re-enabled multiple scrollbar support.
        - added plain scrollbar style and restored xterm scrollbar.
        - blinking and selections work slightly better now.
        - fix an error condition when rxvt receives more than one screenful
          of output. should occur with original rxvt, too, but very rarely.
          (I guess the code contains more surprises of this sort...)

1.7  Fri Jan 30 16:50:11 CET 2004
	- further cleanups.
        - never do last-minute-changes: restore ability to have
          color + bold ass high-intensity, and let the selection
          use reverse video, not _blink_.
        - remove OPTION_HC, at least temporarily. If you want it back,
          please drop me a note.

1.6  Fri Jan 30 00:34:01 CET 2004
	- cleanups, minor bugfixes.
        - blinking text.
        - normal text color + bold gets white text instead of
          normal text when colorBD is not set.
        (- support double-byte characters (by blocking).)
          was not implemented

1.5  Thu Jan 29 00:43:48 CET 2004
	- share io manager between rxvt-unicode and vpe
        - bugfix for --disable-utmp, reported by fefe himself
        - colors were sometimes not used correctly because
          parts of the code expected a monochrome display.
          reported by fefe
        - make it compile without pointer_blank, reported by
          Markus Demleitner
        - improved selection support, now supports UTF8_STRING
          and properly encodes CUT_BUFFER0 in iso-8859-1
        - completely removed non-working graphics mode

1.4  Fri Jan 16 23:03:22 CET 2004
	- fix stupid segfault on esc-c
        - small font tunings
        - much better io manager, less bugs, higher speed
        - better error reporting for unknown options

1.3  2003-12-26
        - fix a bug in font height selection
        - autoscale scalable x11 fonts
        - slow-mode xft rendering centers characters
        - much faster x11 font selecti

1.2  2003-12-24
        - fix another segfault-on-resize-bug form the original rxvt
        - better font matching
        - better memory management (less memory)
        - new fallback: gnu freefont

1.1  2003-12-18
        - Support for XIM in other than the current locale.
        - Support for non-utf-8-locales
