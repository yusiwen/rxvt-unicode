Lines marked with "xterm:" indicate either xterm features ported to rxvt
or changed rxvt behaviour to make it more compatible to xterm (usually
xfree86's xterm).

TODO: implement xterm mode to be able to use xfree's TERM=xterm.
      (except for the keymapping this should be done now).
TODO: multibyte support for setwmname et al.
TODO: there are other todo items, but they are not in this file.

	- fix inheritpixmap transparency border code.
        - fix tinting transparency border code, also experimentally
          make some scrollbars transparent (e.g. plain, my favourite style :).
        - imported aterm shading code (faster and still portable).
        - changed interpretation and usage of shading (-sh).
        - fixed blinking underlined and negative text.
        - disable slow link support on connections using unix domain sockets,
          speeding up scrolling immensely.
        - various other optimizations.
        - new borderLess switch (ewmh-compliant), by Mikael Magnusson
          ******************* MISSING DOCS ***********

3.3  Sat Jul 31 15:15:59 CEST 2004
	- some doc updates (Eduard Bloch).
	- use faster inheritpixmap method when tinting color not set.
	- fix pixmap offset when tinting (reported by Eduard Bloch).
        - new -sh option by Mikael Magnusson.
	- off-focus-fading (--enable-fading) support (patch by
          Mikael Magnusson).
      	- cursor now set correctly on --disable-blank (reported by
          Mikael Magnusson).
        - better (and non-crashing) slipwheeling (Mikael Magnusson).
	- solaris 2.8 portability changes (reported by Colin Marquardt).
      	- disable-xim now really disables xim code.

3.2  Mon Jul 26 19:57:32 CEST 2004
        - support real bold fonts (patch by Adam Sampson <azz@us-lot.org>),
          if specified in the font list (and enabled by -rb).
        - fixed --enable-keepscrolling and --enable-selectionscrolling, which
          was broken since 1.8. Patch by Hans de Goede <j.w.r.degoede@hhs.nl>.
        - fixed --enable-slipwheeling, see above.
	- sequences ended by ST can now contain any octet by quoting it
          with ^V (SYN).
        - 8-bit-controls disabled by default (compiletime option).

3.1  Sat Jun 26 23:38:07 CEST 2004
	- set default backspace sequence to "DEC" (which defaults to \177)
          as opposed to \010 as before, which was incorrect (ahem :).
        - updated doc/etc/rxvt.* to reflect the change. This brings rxvt
          in line with many existing rxvt terminfo and termcap entries as
          well as with other terminal emulators.
	- fix a segfault when trying to set a nonexistant locale
          (reported by elmex).
        - find more fonts by default for japanese.
        - the internal border wasn't always cleared. This is fixed by moving
          the window relative to it's frame and simplifies a lot of code, too.
        - fixed quite hard to find scrollbar colour bug, reported by Eduard
          Bloch.

3.0  Mon May 10 20:47:23 CEST 2004
	- experimental flickerfree resize mode (I tried to get even
	  less flickering with SouthWestGravity but couldn't get it to work,
	  sorry).
	- c++-ify (or at least make it compile with g++-3.4, which should
	  make it a little bit more correct c++).

2.9  Sat May  8 19:13:41 CEST 2004
        - fix some minor doc issues + some generated doc files are now
          getting distributed (closes debian bug #246035).
        - minor i18n issue fixes.

2.8  Thu Apr  8 22:44:36 CEST 2004
	- replace PF_LOCAL by PF_UNIX (portability).
        - try to detect -lnsl and -lsocket (portability).
        - fix some minor bugs.

2.7  Mon Apr  5 02:11:15 CEST 2004
	- this version should now work fine with TERM=xterm, except
          for the keymappings.
        - don't leave the X or rxvtd sockets open in child processes.
          (inherited fd's stay open - different to rxvt).
	- xterm: implemented OSC3, set/get window property. get is an
          extension and is slightly ugly.
	- removed --disable-swapscreen and SCROLL_ON_NO_SECONDARY and
          replaced them by runtime-configurable options secondaryScreen and
          secondaryScroll (-ssr and -ssc) (see debian bug #237673).
	- close down terminal window when child exits. (debian bug #241267).
        - xterm: enable seperate mouse bg colour setting.
        - re-enable mouse cursor colours again, fixing colours when fg/bg are
          overwritten (as is common).
        - xterm: correctly implement privmodes 1047, 1048, 1049.
        - ported to solaris by elmar@math.uni-bremen.de.

2.6  Fri Apr  2 03:24:10 CEST 2004
	- minor doc corrections.
        - WARNING: changed menu sequence from ESC ] 10 to ESC ] 703 to
          avoid clashes with xterm.
        - changed OSC701/OSC702 sequence to return standard escaped reports.
        - xterm: make set window colour and other requests report window
          colour when arg is "?".
        - enable colour tinting of "transparent" backgrounds.
        - stop ST sequences earlier, as we now react on 0x90 and thus
          cause conditions more often that look like locks but are, in
          fact, just rxvt waiting for a ST/BEL etc.
        - re-enabled most of the "dangerous" echo escapes, but only
          when -insecure is specified as option or resource (see reference).
          (FRILLS).
        - disables sleep(1) on transparency updates on default.
        - fixes to make it compile better on solaris 2.9 (at least).
          asprintf replacement is still missing(!).
        - set _NET_WM_PID.

2.5  Sun Mar 28 04:05:51 CEST 2004
	- the usual sprinkled little code cleanups.
        - support more 8-bit controls.
        - more informative error messages.
        - fix some minor memleaks and possible memory corruptions.
        - the use of exception handling allowed the following improvements:
        - no longer block when waiting for completion of escape sequences
          (e.g. printf '\e';sleep 3;printf 'c' will no longer block).
        - rxvtc usage errors should no longer kill rxvtd (debian bug #237510).

2.4  Tue Mar 16 07:06:51 CET 2004
	- fix stupid double-free() bug on exit.
	- implement xterm private mode 1049.
        - fix manpages (debian bug #236824).
        - removed old selection style completely.
        - selection works _better_ for non-8-bit and double-width chars.
        - remove native->unicode translation tables. they aren't used anymore.
          reduces binary and distro size a bit.
        - add string representation for JIS X 0213:2000 so these fonts can
          be used from within rxvt.
        - less buggy complete set of line-drawing-characters (0x2500-0x259f).

2.3  Sun Mar 14 19:00:07 CET 2004
	- code cleanup release.
	- fix compile problems without --enable-combining.
        - fix segfault when DISPLAY cannot be opened.
        - removed HOTKEY_CTRL and HOTKEY_SHIFT, ACS_*, FONT0_IDX,
          MAX_NFONTS. UNICODE and UTF8 defines and references from
          all files.
        - default config now reads an app-defaults file even without
          --enable-xgetdefaults.

2.2  Thu Mar 11 01:41:56 CET 2004
        - implement autocompositing of characters by either using an existing
          precomposed unicode character or by graphical overlay. this is
          also used to store characters >16bit without --enable-unicode3.
        - selection now based on wchar_t, so that it can offer UTF-8
          selections even in locales unable to represent full unicode.
	- tis620-2529 is, of course, thai, not vietnamese...
        - a typoe prevented characters >65535 to be stored properly.
        - wcwidth is unreliable in non-unicode-locales on GNU/Linux.
          working around this fixes line-drawing characters in non-utf-8 mode.
        - improved rounding when emulating line-drawing characters.
        - implement continuation lines in xresource parsing when
          --disable-xgetdefault.
        - changed locale-setting esc-sequence from code 9 to code 701.
          also added 702 that returns the font selected for a specific
          unicode character.
        - no longer set XA_CUT_BUFFER0. this is confusing and clients WILL
          get it wrong.
        - don't use XTextStyle for XA_TEXT, instead use XStdICCTextStyle.

2.1  Wed Mar  3 21:48:39 CET 2004
	- NOTE: the name of the binary and ressources were changed in
          this version, see README.configure if you want the old
          settings.
        - added plain "big5" encoding into CN.
        - make cns11643 and big5* encodings actually visible to rxvt.
        - fix a bug when a multibyte character fell onto a buffer boundary,
          causing the incomplete character to be presented twice to
          mbrtowc.
        - more robust encoding name matching.
        - fix cursor placement on multibyte characters.
        - when overwriting wide with narrow chars, pad with spaces.
        - fix various refresh and display issues for wide chars.
        - remove multibyte_cursor hack (it was a hack) and associated
          resources and docs.
        - fixed memory corruption bug with XLFD fontname parsing.

2.0  Sun Feb 29 23:59:58 CET 2004
	- do not blink text when background colour is not set explicitly.
        - some doc cleanup
        - configure cleanup
        - viscii enabled by default
        - better support for non-g++-3.2+ systems (tested with g++-2.95).

1.91 Fri Feb 27 03:57:44 CET 2004
	- build fixes for !xft and !im, reported by various people.

1.9  Wed Feb 25 16:46:05 CET 2004
	- fixed bug in plain scrollbar causing X errors in XCreateGC.
        - implemented sharing of X connections. will be used to speed
          up many x operations considerably. Also saves some memory.
        - implemented caching of input methods. This immensely shortens
          startup time for new terms in rxvtd. At least XFree86 4.3 is
          rather broken with respect to input methods, though, so expect
          crashes when you kill your input method (xterm et al. also crash).
        - fix bugs in X flushing, causing an empty screen after startup.
        - fix various memleaks in rxvtd.
        - fix a bug that kept escape codes to be generated for some
          keysyms that also have string translations, when not --enable-xim.
          reported by joel reed.
        - re-enabled esc-seq. for font-switching (\033 ] 50 ; <fontset> \007).
        - re-enabled menubar (experimental!).
        - fix bug in locale-handling that kept the correct locale from
          being selected.
        - implemented esc-seq. to switch locales (\033 ] 9 ; <locale> \007).
        - removed greek support.
        - allow NUL bytes (ctrl-@) to be entered even with XIM enabled.
        - correct cursor width if !focus.
        - fixed --enable-xgetdefault, reported by eduard bloch.
        - added manpage for rxvtc/rxvtd based on the one eduard block
          contributed.
        - use reverse video for normal bold text unless colorBD has been set.
        - fixed endless loop when selection is valid but empty.
        - changed default terminal name to "rxvt".
        - many other minor bugfixes.

1.8  Mon Feb  2 20:09:18 CET 2004
	- almost total conversion to C++. Except for introducing
          new bugs, this should not change much.
        - fix and re-enable background pixmap and inherit pixmap support.
        - re-enabled multiple scrollbar support.
        - added plain scrollbar style and restored xterm scrollbar.
        - blinking and selections work slightly better now.
        - fix an error condition when rxvt receives more than one screenful
          of output. should occur with original rxvt, too, but very rarely.
          (I guess the code contains more surprises of this sort...)

1.7  Fri Jan 30 16:50:11 CET 2004
	- further cleanups.
        - never do last-minute-changes: restore ability to have
          color + bold as high-intensity, and let the selection
          use reverse video, not _blink_.
        - remove OPTION_HC, at least temporarily. If you want it back,
          please drop me a note.

1.6  Fri Jan 30 00:34:01 CET 2004
	- cleanups, minor bugfixes.
        - blinking text.
        - normal text color + bold gets white text instead of
          normal text when colorBD is not set.
        (- support double-wide characters (by blocking).)
          was never implemented

1.5  Thu Jan 29 00:43:48 CET 2004
	- share io manager between rxvt-unicode and vpe
        - bugfix for --disable-utmp, reported by fefe himself
        - colors were sometimes not used correctly because
          parts of the code expected a monochrome display.
          reported by fefe
        - make it compile without pointer_blank, reported by
          Markus Demleitner
        - improved selection support, now supports UTF8_STRING
          and properly encodes CUT_BUFFER0 in iso-8859-1
        - completely removed non-working graphics mode

1.4  Fri Jan 16 23:03:22 CET 2004
	- fix stupid segfault on esc-c
        - small font tunings
        - much better io manager, less bugs, higher speed
        - better error reporting for unknown options

1.3  2003-12-26
        - fix a bug in font height selection
        - autoscale scalable x11 fonts
        - slow-mode xft rendering centers characters
        - much faster x11 font selection

1.2  2003-12-24
        - fix another segfault-on-resize-bug form the original rxvt
        - better font matching
        - better memory management (less memory)
        - new fallback: gnu freefont

1.1  2003-12-18
        - Support for XIM in other than the current locale.
        - Support for non-utf-8-locales
        - much improved font choosing

1.0
        - first release
        - original cloned from rxvt-CVS 2003-11-19 00:26
        - removed rclock et al.
        - initial conversion to C++
