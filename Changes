          color + bold ass high-intensity, and let the selection
          use reverse video, not _blink_.
        - remove OPTION_HC, at least temporarily. If you want it back,
          please drop me a note.

	- cleanups, minor bugfixes.
        - blinking text.
        - normal text color + bold gets white text instead of
          normal text when colorBD is not set.
        (- support double-byte characters (by blocking).)
          was not implemented

        - colors were sometimes not used correctly because
          parts of the code expected a monochrome display.
          reported by fefe
        - make it compile without pointer_blank, reported by
          Markus Demleitner
