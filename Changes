5.4  Mon Apr 18 00:33:31 CEST 2005
	- match modifier state exactly in custom keyboard code.
          this is necessary because it has no knowledge about
          built-in mappings and so will overwrite them. the priority-code
          will be re-enabled when this has changed, so watch out.
	- cursor blinking now depends on frills.
        - underline cursor mode (frills, -uc).
	- implement special value (*g*) for pointerBlankDelay
          to disble it.

5.3  Sun Mar 13 00:20:44 CET 2005
	- fix a bug that allowed to overflow a buffer via a long
          escape sequence, which is probably exploitable (fix by
          Rob Holland / Yoann Vandoorselaere / Gentoo Audit Team).
        - Custom key mappings no longer confuse mouse buttons
          with modifiers.
	- use XmbSetWMProperties instead of XSetWMProperties.
	- properly update WM_LOCALE.
        - implement _NET_WM_PING protocol.
        - implemented escape sequences to move the scrollback buffer view
          and clear the scrollback buffer.

5.2  Sun Feb 20 01:48:59 CET 2005
	- new option -pty-fd that makes the terminal a slave
          that uses an existing pty for I/O instead of starting
          a command.
        - implement enough of XEMBED to allow for correct focus.
        - added doc/embed-tk, an embedding example in Perl/Tk,
          and doc/rxvt-tabbed, a primitive tabbed shell implemented
          in Perl/Gtk2.
        - fix assertion failure ("crash") on mousewheel-scrolling
          when the terminal height is small, by removing the assert.
          (reported by Mikael Magnusson).
        - SYNCCVS. backported bugfixes done to rxvt
          (sourceforge bugs #1028739, #1028732), except for
          pts/%s fix as it seems to collide with freebsd,
          and sourceforge bug #954654, which is not neccessary.
        - change terminfo file to not clobber G1 when using
          line-drawing characters, as this seems to mess
          with EUC-JP (it will clobber G0, but G0 practically
          needs to be US-ASCII all the time).
        - toggle default application keypad/cursor mode to help
          some apps who fail to set the correct mode.
        - check for WM_PROTOCOLS type in ClientMessage as to
          not destroy the window for other types of messages.
	- remove shared library (or any library) support - it is
          of no use currently (and -embed is a better way to embed
          rxvt-unicode).
        - get rid of the intpro files.

5.1  Tue Feb 15 17:13:27 CET 2005
	- fix a bug when parsing fontnames and another one
          for empty keymaps which could result in crashes
          (Kuang-che Wu).
        - new option: -embed (frills). somebody could write a simple
          tk script to make a tab'able terminal now...
        - only warn on X errors and _try_ to continue (frills).
        - add COPYING back, which got lost somehow.
        - after deciding that LSM is dead, remove all traces of it,
          along with other, similar, cleanups.
        - _try_ to react sensibly to some non-monotonic time changes.
        - don't crash in urxvtc when getcwd fails (reported by Paco-Paco).
        - tweak font searching algorithm a bit to be faster and more
          compatible with older rxvt-unicode versions when multiple fonts
          match (reported by Paco-Paco).
        - urxvtd tries to stay in "/" whenever possible.

5.0  Fri Feb 11 18:31:48 CET 2005
	- document a race-free hack to start urxvtd.
        - document all(?) environment variables used and set by rxvt.
        - bring xgetdefault-style resource file ordering more in line with
          Xt, and document it in rxvt(1).
        - correctly use screen-dependent resources when --enable-xgetdefault,
          and also fix some memory bugs (thanks to Thierry Reding for
          his patience and time in tracking this down).
        - bring own resource parsing more in line with X resource parsing,
          most notably, don't remove double quotes.
	- compile fix for freebsd (no ut_id) (Thierry Thomas).
        - clean up utmp and pty on X I/O errors and signals (idea
          by Joël Riou).
        - "un"document -xrm, it never really worked, was only
          available with --enable-xgetdefault, is not necessary
          and is surprisingly hard to implement.
        - shaved off some code segment size.
        - various code cleanups.
        - more keysym-mapping fixes.

4.9  Thu Feb  3 09:52:03 CET 2005
        - nuke out utmp entries completely. Should be fixed in
          original rxvt, too. (reported by James Michael Fultz).
        - resizes wil now correctly refresh the displayed text when
          -pixmap is active.
        - new option/resource imFont.
        - document --tripleclickwords/-tcw.
        - select logical instead of physical lines when doing a triple-click.
        - reordered help listing to group similar options together.
        - handle SIGINT the same way as SIGTERM (reported by Joël Riou).
        - fix a bug introduced while applying the keyboard patch
          (WU Fengguang).
        - document all window-op sequences (rxvt.7.) and more keysym
          examples (rxvt.1).
        - removed src/test completely.
        - renamed keysym 'proto:'-prefix to 'command:'.

4.8  Tue Jan 18 02:23:57 CET 2005
        - added a patch by WU Fengguang that makes the keyboard
          highly configurable (e.g. locale changes, custom escape
          sequences, and more). See keysym resource in rxvt(1).
        - remove default key sequence for unknown keys again, as this
          can be achieved by customizing the keyboard now.
        - fix some freeing problems when destroying the rxvt_display,
          resulting in segfaults.
        - don't crash when the saved cursor position doesn't fit on the
          screen (wrong assert in original rxvt, reported by ikaro).
        - fix signed/unsigned bugs on wc<->mb conversions.
        - reset slipwheel scrolling speed when reaching the top or bottom
          (Mikael Magnusson).
        - for core fonts, use ascent + descent when a font is loaded,
          and PIXEL_SIZE when not. when loading a font, iterate until a
          font has been found that _really_ fits the height (reported and
          tested by Olivier Wittenberg).
        - set IUTF8 input flag, when defined (linux-2.6.5+).
        - only define _XOPEN_SOURCE on solaris.
        - autogenerate src/* dependency list.
        - fixed linespace option, which ought to work now (and is dependent
          on frills, not on it's own configure option).
        - include pty.h, if available (cygwin).
        - removed W11 directory from dist, it wasn't used anyway.
        - initialize the locale much earlier.
        - fixed two tiny per-instance memory leaks.

4.7  Wed Dec 29 20:54:24 CET 2004
        - fix a bug in the event logic that could cause the temrinal to be
          black on initial startup.
        - do NOT call XCloseIM, ever. This causes way to many crashes due to
          races in the protocol and within Xlib.
	- map iso-left-tab to the same sequence as shift-tab.
        - generate a unique escape sequence for many unknown keys, such as
          additional multimedia keys.
        - mask out high (non-unicode) bits on wide characters, to cope with
          implementations that store tag info in the high bits.

4.6  Thu Dec 16 07:54:23 CET 2004
	- try very hard not to exhaust the kernel tty buffers, even
          if it slows down large pastes and is only cosmetic.
        - streamline atom and xft color allocation to reduce startup
          time (12.8s -> 7.8s on my dsl). Still, doing it with only 2-3
          turnarounds would be much faster, but impossible to implement(?).
        - implement underlineColor resource when ENABLE_FRILLS.
        - iom left it's signal pipe handle open in the child
          process. Fortunately not security-relevant as the pipe data gets
          ignored.
        - do not use XSETROOTPMAP_ID anymore, support ESETROOT_PMAP_ID
          instead.
        - fix a crash in rxvtd when the last window was being closed
          (reported by hednod).
        - fix an unlikely memory leak.
        - fix atom name enumeration.

4.5  Mon Dec 13 07:47:16 CET 2004
	- fix an extremely nasty bug in utf8-conversion. upgrade is advised.
        - completely re-wrote selection pasting. This should fix garbled
          incomplete characters at 32k boundaries and too-short INCR
          selections, and more. Increases memory requirements considerably
          for large selections, but that seems unavoidable.

4.4  Sun Dec 12 22:10:06 CET 2004
	- rewrote handling of default-char width.
        - implement _NET_WM_NAME et al., and also use UTF8_STRING
          for the xterm property esc. sequence. Allows i18n window
          titles etc.
        - SMART_WINDOW_TITLE removed, pls. complain if you need this.
        - added GBK encoding (formidable patch by WU Fengguang).
        - fixed a bug in the transparency code.
        - upgraded iom.[Ch].
        - force slower (but more responsive) transparency update.
        - fix off-by-one bug with wide characters at the end of a line,
          which got partially overwritten by spaces.
        - as xlib is completely broken with respect to utf-8 handling
          and nobody is going to fix it, that part has been re-implemented.
          should fix most paste problems between apps that use UTF8 encoding
          and rxvt running in a lesser-supported locale (thanks to Robin Redeker
          for writing utf8towcs). Only enabled with ENABLE_FRILLS.
        - darwin compile fix by Ethan Blanton.
        - fix the colour of the underline, which was rather random before.

4.3  Sat Dec  4 04:58:37 CET 2004
        - unapply the "emulated graphical chars. respect wcwidth" patch.
          obviously in locales not having these characters they should
          still have a width. Solve it correctly by not relying on wcwidth.
          Note to self: do not ever apply patches without checking them
          thoroughly.
   	- updated .spec file, it's included in the release tarball
          now, too.

4.2  Wed Dec  1 03:30:22 CET 2004
	- make emulated graphical characters respect wcwidth (Kuang-che Wu).
        - remove debugging code that caused major slowdowns
          on high-latency networks.
        - wide characters shift the correct number of characters
          in insert mode now. Reported by Gunnar Ritter.
        - doc/rxvt-unicode.spec file contributed by Ville Herva.
        - make storage of tab movements as characters optional
          on the -ptab option and pastableTabs: resource. On request
          by Gunnar Ritter.
        - fix a bug where :size= argument for xft fonts was ignored
          or used incorrectly. Reported by Ville Herva.

4.1  Sun Nov 21 21:10:19 CET 2004
	- save and restore cursor position in secondary screen regardless of
          -ssc/-ssr settings.
	- fix some 64-bit bugs that lead to crashes with certain other
          programs like vncviewer (original rxvt also affected).
	- added doc/podtbl to the dist tarball.
        - add compile fix for darwin.
        - configure fix for transparency without tinting.
        - changed CN to ZH _really_ everywhere.
        - upgraded iom.[Ch].

4.0  Mon Sep 13 01:10:26 CEST 2004
	- turn off autohinting for some badly-hinted fallback fonts.
        - mnaapge tpyo crorcetoins by Bastian Kleineidam.
        - implemented rectangular selections (button+meta), experimental.
        - implement race-free signal handling in iom.C.
        - use iom.C signal handling to avoid races in signal handling.
        - use default action on SIGINT and SIGQUIT, instead of terminating.
        - "the return of the 100 times per second refresh bug".
          ... terminated by a fix.
        - new supported preeeditType "None".
        - added FAQ about possible compose key problems.
        - changed CN to ZH everywhere (sorry for the confusion).
        - move XFilterEvent up, as some input method seem to want events
          for windows not requesting XIM. Please report if this change
          causes any harm (specially with pointerblanking)
          (patch by Kuang-che Wu).
        - send the input method spot position on every refresh, not just
          when rxvt thinks it should (which was not often enough...).
        - fix double-wide combining characters (it might look a bit ugly,
          though, but common cases are handled by normalization anyways).
        - moved FAQ to rxvt(7), also made a copy into README.FAQ.
        - fix a bug(?) in the XIM destroy callback.
        - be more conservative when trying to register new input methods,
          as Xlib races might make rxvt crash. When two or more
          input methods are active, killing one probably still crashes rxvt
          due to that bug :( Thanks a lot to Kuang-che Wu for immense help
          in tracking this down.
        - manpages (but not .txt and .html versions) will be patched (during
          make install) with the correct program name and other info.

3.9  Wed Aug 25 19:24:04 CEST 2004
	- the change to unsigned int from unsigned short broke
          many signed comparisons, resulting in failed assertions.

3.8  Wed Aug 25 05:46:56 CEST 2004
        - WARNING: TERM=rxvt-unicode is now *default* unless compiled
          differently. A terminfo entry will automatically be compiled and
          installed if tic is available.
        - fixed some --disable switches that didn't work.
        - tweaked src/features.h a bit.
        - removed README.unicode.
        - support select&paste of tab characters.
        - fixed a segfault when trying to load nonexistant fonts (reported
          by Eduard Bloch and Mikael Magnusson).
        - fixed a long-standing rxvt bug in which rxvt failed to save
          and restore the correct cursor position on the secondary screen.
        - reworked rxvt-unicode terminfo to allow more efficient and less flickering
          screen updates with curses.
        - wide characters that are being halfway overwritten are now replaced
          by spaces.
        - urxvtc now transmits urxvt as default name, not urxvtc anymore
          (likewise for other names chosen at configure time).
        - disabled the automatic font lookup for unknown characters. xft
          is just too slow for this to work.
        - changed realbold code, implemented _real_ bold and italic support,
          where _real_ means the symbiosis of what I want with what I can
          implement. use --enable-styles.
        - removed 256 color mode, but enable 88 colours in all modes
          (88 to be compatible with 88 colour xterm which is widely
          supported, and most programs assume a non-iso colourtable
          for terminals with "odd" number of colours).
        - added doc/etc/rxvt-unicode.terminfo which is a big overhaul
          compared to the old rxvt terminfo.
	- sped up xft rendering by 30% *iff* the font allows it (i.e. is
          monospaced "enough") *and* matches the base font in width.
        - implement positive and negative character-font caching, which
          speeds up output immensely in case a character cannot be found
          (only for non-bold right now).
        - fix segfault in fading code on certain escape sequences.
        - better default font size and style.
        - rxvt-unicode is now much more picky about fonts not fitting
          into the base font, but to offset this it will check each
          single character against the base font extents and will only
          use the characters fitting into the bounding box (+ some fudge).
        - characters not fitting into the base boundary box will now often
          be used anyways, but the following characters will be redrawn
          more often to avoid pixel-droppings. This is like the original
          rxvt pixel-dropping pass but it's much faster.
        - scrollColor now affects plain scrollbar (Mikael Magnusson).
        - fixed segfault in overlay code when height was larger than the
          screen height.
        - cursor no longer shines "through" the overlay.
        - 7-bit ST marker detection was broken.
        - scrollbar didn't come back sometimes when switching it
          off/on using escape sequences (Mikael Magnusson).
        - fix lots of colour problems with focus fading.
        - $COLORFGBG was not set as documented.
        - fix iso 14755 5.1 support when --enable-frills but --disable-iso14755.
        - removed OSC 702.
        - disabled MOUSE_REPORT_DOUBLECLICK by default, as programs seem to be
          confused by it rather than using it.

3.7  Tue Aug 17 04:22:25 CEST 2004
	- new configure option --enable-iso14755.
        - full iso 14755 conformance (at least I claim so :).
        - extended the FAQ section in the manpage.
	- fix OverTheSpot and OffTheSpot editing, which was broken since ages,
          due to no fontset being available. The fontset used is a very rough
          approximation to the rxvt font, though. This fixes the
          "cannot create input context" in most cases.
        - fix coordinates used for Over && OffTheSpot editing to fit directly
          at the cursor (Over) or into the top line (Off).
        - reset SIGHUP and SIGPIPE handlers to default values (they were
          previously being ignored, causing programs not to exit on windoe
          close).
        - implemented simple overlays for feedback messages. believe it or
          not, this was a major blocker in implementign tabbed termianls.
        - fix compiling with --disable-frills (Adam Sampson).
        - clarify bold docs in README.unicode (Adam Sampson).
	- fix crash on window close when the input method or context
          could not be created.
        - add work around for badly written programs (see debian bug
          #202497). This is _not_ a bug in rxvt but rather a race
          condition in other programs (e.g. jed). It works by forcefully
          sending SIGWINCH when rxvt sees the first output from the
          command. This workaround isn't perfect (a slight cost to
          wellbehaving programs who need to resize twice), but it usually
          works.
	- set correct pixel size in struct winsize.
        - document more escape sequences.
        - fix leftover macros and a few minor doc glitches in rxvt(1).
        - work around bash's assumption that stepping into the middle of a
          character is a sensible operation.
        - fix some corner cases in autowrap handling.
        - remove various useless make cruft, renamed files to better
          reflect on their function, renamed many variables.
        - fixed printscreen functionality, as noted by Jinesh Choksi.
        - fix a problem where redraws of double-width characters sometimes
          made the last character draw with normal width (especially visible
          with selections).

3.6  Sat Aug 14 04:55:26 CEST 2004
        - SECURITY FIX: rxvtd kept open filehandles to other terminal
          windows when spawning children. Actual risk is low (attacker
          needs access to a local shell window).
        - implemented parts 5.1 and 5.2 of ISO 14755 (i.e. hold down
          Ctrl+Shift and enter hex numbers. space commits it as a unicode
          character, or press and release Crl+Shift and then enter a
          function key to get it's picture). patches for 5.3 (or 5.4 with
          a little window or so) would be welcome.
        - fixed large pastes (INCR selections, debian bug #191456).
        - fixed longstanding bug in which rxvtd crashed when
          a message was logged after startup (a rare case).
        - got rid of yodl completely by converting to pod.
        - integrated the FAQ into the manpage. In the future, more will be
          added there.
        - reference documentation is now installed as rxvt(7).
        - rxvt(7) now contains README.configure, which is autogenerated.
	- fix memory leak in insecure mode on certain display echos.
        - report sequences now report empty strings in secure mode
          instead of being ignored.
        - enable some report sequences even in secure mode, such as colour
          queries, as they are harmless(tm).
        - rxvt-unicode will now try to find a matching xft font if it can't
          find a matching font from the fallback list. It might look ugly,
          but if a xft font with our character exists, rxvt will find it.
        - moved FreeMono to the very back of the fallback list, as some
          people complain it looks ugly. This is a no-win situation, though.
        - fixed sourceforge bug 998970, reported against aterm:
          "crash on -sl 0 on super small windows".
        - decreased memory and code size when !--enable-transparency.
        - SYNCCVS. backported changes done to rxvt, except for Color_ufbg,
          which I think is better done through fading, and libW11, which
          needs testing anyways.
          - more complete compile options help output.
          - Provide linear scaled colour cubes for 256 colour mode.
            Pass them through as rgbi rather than rgb so that Xlib can
            provide gamma (from per visual intensity lists) rather than
            providing constant gamma ourselves.  Noticed by and ideas from
            Christopher Casey <realchriscasey@hotmail.com>
          - minor doc fix.

3.5  Wed Aug 11 00:31:34 CEST 2004
        - UPGRADE ADVISED: rxvt did wake up 100 times per second. did not
          show in my top (linux...), but it's extremely annoying that I
          released it with that bug. :( Fixed.
	- use memove instead of for-loop for large scrollback buffer copies.
          speeds up large scrollback buffers (on systems with reasonable
          memmove :)
	- minor cleanups.
        - removed ~ from default cutchars, in accordance with the manpage
          (debian bug #169415).
        - fix a race condition on exit (debian bug #197265).
        - change prio/next scrolling modifier handling (debian bug #226386).
        - updated configure script to current autoconf standards.
        - updated config.guess.

3.4  Fri Aug  6 19:34:29 CEST 2004
	- fix inheritpixmap transparency border code.
        - fix tinting transparency border code, also experimentally
          make some scrollbars transparent (e.g. plain, my favourite style :).
        - imported aterm shading code (faster and still portable).
        - changed interpretation and usage of shading (-sh).
        - fixed blinking underlined and negative text.
        - disable slow link support on connections using unix domain sockets,
          speeding up scrolling immensely.
        - various other optimizations.
        - new borderLess switch (ewmh-compliant), by Mikael Magnusson.

3.3  Sat Jul 31 15:15:59 CEST 2004
	- some doc updates (Eduard Bloch).
	- use faster inheritpixmap method when tinting color not set.
	- fix pixmap offset when tinting (reported by Eduard Bloch).
        - new -sh option by Mikael Magnusson.
	- off-focus-fading (--enable-fading) support (patch by
          Mikael Magnusson).
      	- cursor now set correctly on --disable-blank (reported by
          Mikael Magnusson).
        - better (and non-crashing) slipwheeling (Mikael Magnusson).
	- solaris 2.8 portability changes (reported by Colin Marquardt).
      	- disable-xim now really disables xim code.

3.2  Mon Jul 26 19:57:32 CEST 2004
        - support real bold fonts (patch by Adam Sampson <azz@us-lot.org>),
          if specified in the font list (and enabled by -rb).
        - fixed --enable-keepscrolling and --enable-selectionscrolling, which
          was broken since 1.8. Patch by Hans de Goede <j.w.r.degoede@hhs.nl>.
        - fixed --enable-slipwheeling, see above.
	- sequences ended by ST can now contain any octet by quoting it
          with ^V (SYN).
        - 8-bit-controls disabled by default (compiletime option).

3.1  Sat Jun 26 23:38:07 CEST 2004
	- set default backspace sequence to "DEC" (which defaults to \177)
          as opposed to \010 as before, which was incorrect (ahem :).
        - updated doc/etc/rxvt.* to reflect the change. This brings rxvt
          in line with many existing rxvt terminfo and termcap entries as
          well as with other terminal emulators.
	- fix a segfault when trying to set a nonexistant locale
          (reported by elmex).
        - find more fonts by default for japanese.
        - the internal border wasn't always cleared. This is fixed by moving
          the window relative to it's frame and simplifies a lot of code, too.
        - fixed quite hard to find scrollbar colour bug, reported by Eduard
          Bloch.

3.0  Mon May 10 20:47:23 CEST 2004
	- experimental flickerfree resize mode (I tried to get even
	  less flickering with SouthWestGravity but couldn't get it to work,
	  sorry).
	- c++-ify (or at least make it compile with g++-3.4, which should
	  make it a little bit more correct c++).

2.9  Sat May  8 19:13:41 CEST 2004
        - fix some minor doc issues + some generated doc files are now
          getting distributed (closes debian bug #246035).
        - minor i18n issue fixes.

2.8  Thu Apr  8 22:44:36 CEST 2004
	- replace PF_LOCAL by PF_UNIX (portability).
        - try to detect -lnsl and -lsocket (portability).
        - fix some minor bugs.

2.7  Mon Apr  5 02:11:15 CEST 2004
	- this version should now work fine with TERM=xterm, except
          for the keymappings.
        - don't leave the X or rxvtd sockets open in child processes.
          (inherited fd's stay open - different to rxvt).
        - xterm-compat: implemented OSC3, set/get window property. get is
          an extension and is slightly ugly.
	- removed --disable-swapscreen and SCROLL_ON_NO_SECONDARY and
          replaced them by runtime-configurable options secondaryScreen and
          secondaryScroll (-ssr and -ssc) (see debian bug #237673).
	- close down terminal window when child exits. (debian bug #241267).
        - xterm-compat: enable seperate mouse bg colour setting.
        - re-enable mouse cursor colours again, fixing colours when fg/bg are
          overwritten (as is common).
        - xterm-compat: correctly implement privmodes 1047, 1048, 1049.
        - ported to solaris by elmar@math.uni-bremen.de.

2.6  Fri Apr  2 03:24:10 CEST 2004
	- minor doc corrections.
        - WARNING: changed menu sequence from ESC ] 10 to ESC ] 703 to
          avoid clashes with xterm.
        - changed OSC701/OSC702 sequence to return standard escaped reports.
        - xterm-compat: make set window colour and other requests report
          window colour when arg is "?".
        - enable colour tinting of "transparent" backgrounds.
        - stop ST sequences earlier, as we now react on 0x90 and thus
          cause conditions more often that look like locks but are, in
          fact, just rxvt waiting for a ST/BEL etc.
        - re-enabled most of the "dangerous" echo escapes, but only
          when -insecure is specified as option or resource (see reference).
          (FRILLS).
        - disables sleep(1) on transparency updates on default.
        - fixes to make it compile better on solaris 2.9 (at least).
          asprintf replacement is still missing(!).
        - set _NET_WM_PID.

2.5  Sun Mar 28 04:05:51 CEST 2004
	- the usual sprinkled little code cleanups.
        - support more 8-bit controls.
        - more informative error messages.
        - fix some minor memleaks and possible memory corruptions.
        - the use of exception handling allowed the following improvements:
        - no longer block when waiting for completion of escape sequences
          (e.g. printf '\e';sleep 3;printf 'c' will no longer block).
        - rxvtc usage errors should no longer kill rxvtd (debian bug #237510).

2.4  Tue Mar 16 07:06:51 CET 2004
	- fix stupid double-free() bug on exit.
	- implement xterm private mode 1049.
        - fix manpages (debian bug #236824).
        - removed old selection style completely.
        - selection works _better_ for non-8-bit and double-width chars.
        - remove native->unicode translation tables. they aren't used anymore.
          reduces binary and distro size a bit.
        - add string representation for JIS X 0213:2000 so these fonts can
          be used from within rxvt.
        - less buggy complete set of line-drawing-characters (0x2500-0x259f).

2.3  Sun Mar 14 19:00:07 CET 2004
	- code cleanup release.
	- fix compile problems without --enable-combining.
        - fix segfault when DISPLAY cannot be opened.
        - removed HOTKEY_CTRL and HOTKEY_SHIFT, ACS_*, FONT0_IDX,
          MAX_NFONTS. UNICODE and UTF8 defines and references from
          all files.
        - default config now reads an app-defaults file even without
          --enable-xgetdefaults.

2.2  Thu Mar 11 01:41:56 CET 2004
        - implement autocompositing of characters by either using an existing
          precomposed unicode character or by graphical overlay. this is
          also used to store characters >16bit without --enable-unicode3.
        - selection now based on wchar_t, so that it can offer UTF-8
          selections even in locales unable to represent full unicode.
	- tis620-2529 is, of course, thai, not vietnamese...
        - a typoe prevented characters >65535 to be stored properly.
        - wcwidth is unreliable in non-unicode-locales on GNU/Linux.
          working around this fixes line-drawing characters in non-utf-8 mode.
        - improved rounding when emulating line-drawing characters.
        - implement continuation lines in xresource parsing when
          --disable-xgetdefault.
        - changed locale-setting esc-sequence from code 9 to code 701.
          also added 702 that returns the font selected for a specific
          unicode character.
        - no longer set XA_CUT_BUFFER0. this is confusing and clients WILL
          get it wrong.
        - don't use XTextStyle for XA_TEXT, instead use XStdICCTextStyle.

2.1  Wed Mar  3 21:48:39 CET 2004
	- NOTE: the name of the binary and ressources were changed in
          this version, see README.configure if you want the old
          settings.
        - added plain "big5" encoding into CN.
        - make cns11643 and big5* encodings actually visible to rxvt.
        - fix a bug when a multibyte character fell onto a buffer boundary,
          causing the incomplete character to be presented twice to
          mbrtowc.
        - more robust encoding name matching.
        - fix cursor placement on multibyte characters.
        - when overwriting wide with narrow chars, pad with spaces.
        - fix various refresh and display issues for wide chars.
        - remove multibyte_cursor hack (it was a hack) and associated
          resources and docs.
        - fixed memory corruption bug with XLFD fontname parsing.

2.0  Sun Feb 29 23:59:58 CET 2004
	- do not blink text when background colour is not set explicitly.
        - some doc cleanup
        - configure cleanup
        - viscii enabled by default
        - better support for non-g++-3.2+ systems (tested with g++-2.95).

1.91 Fri Feb 27 03:57:44 CET 2004
	- build fixes for !xft and !im, reported by various people.

1.9  Wed Feb 25 16:46:05 CET 2004
	- fixed bug in plain scrollbar causing X errors in XCreateGC.
        - implemented sharing of X connections. will be used to speed
          up many x operations considerably. Also saves some memory.
        - implemented caching of input methods. This immensely shortens
          startup time for new terms in rxvtd. At least XFree86 4.3 is
          rather broken with respect to input methods, though, so expect
          crashes when you kill your input method (xterm et al. also crash).
        - fix bugs in X flushing, causing an empty screen after startup.
        - fix various memleaks in rxvtd.
        - fix a bug that kept escape codes to be generated for some
          keysyms that also have string translations, when not --enable-xim.
          reported by joel reed.
        - re-enabled esc-seq. for font-switching (\033 ] 50 ; <fontset> \007).
        - re-enabled menubar (experimental!).
        - fix bug in locale-handling that kept the correct locale from
          being selected.
        - implemented esc-seq. to switch locales (\033 ] 9 ; <locale> \007).
        - removed greek support.
        - allow NUL bytes (ctrl-@) to be entered even with XIM enabled.
        - correct cursor width if !focus.
        - fixed --enable-xgetdefault, reported by eduard bloch.
        - added manpage for rxvtc/rxvtd based on the one eduard block
          contributed.
        - use reverse video for normal bold text unless colorBD has been set.
        - fixed endless loop when selection is valid but empty.
        - changed default terminal name to "rxvt".
        - many other minor bugfixes.

1.8  Mon Feb  2 20:09:18 CET 2004
	- almost total conversion to C++. Except for introducing
          new bugs, this should not change much.
        - fix and re-enable background pixmap and inherit pixmap support.
        - re-enabled multiple scrollbar support.
        - added plain scrollbar style and restored xterm scrollbar.
        - blinking and selections work slightly better now.
        - fix an error condition when rxvt receives more than one screenful
          of output. should occur with original rxvt, too, but very rarely.
          (I guess the code contains more surprises of this sort...)

1.7  Fri Jan 30 16:50:11 CET 2004
	- further cleanups.
        - never do last-minute-changes: restore ability to have
          color + bold as high-intensity, and let the selection
          use reverse video, not _blink_.
        - remove OPTION_HC, at least temporarily. If you want it back,
          please drop me a note.

1.6  Fri Jan 30 00:34:01 CET 2004
	- cleanups, minor bugfixes.
        - blinking text.
        - normal text color + bold gets white text instead of
          normal text when colorBD is not set.
        (- support double-wide characters (by blocking).)
          was never implemented

1.5  Thu Jan 29 00:43:48 CET 2004
	- share io manager between rxvt-unicode and vpe
        - bugfix for --disable-utmp, reported by fefe himself
        - colors were sometimes not used correctly because
          parts of the code expected a monochrome display.
          reported by fefe
        - make it compile without pointer_blank, reported by
          Markus Demleitner
        - improved selection support, now supports UTF8_STRING
          and properly encodes CUT_BUFFER0 in iso-8859-1
        - completely removed non-working graphics mode

1.4  Fri Jan 16 23:03:22 CET 2004
	- fix stupid segfault on esc-c
        - small font tunings
        - much better io manager, less bugs, higher speed
        - better error reporting for unknown options

1.3  2003-12-26
        - fix a bug in font height selection
        - autoscale scalable x11 fonts
        - slow-mode xft rendering centers characters
        - much faster x11 font selection

1.2  2003-12-24
        - fix another segfault-on-resize-bug form the original rxvt
        - better font matching
        - better memory management (less memory)
        - new fallback: gnu freefont

1.1  2003-12-18
        - Support for XIM in other than the current locale.
        - Support for non-utf-8-locales
        - much improved font choosing

1.0
        - first release
        - originally cloned from rxvt-CVS 2003-11-19 00:26
        - removed rclock et al.
        - initial conversion to C++
