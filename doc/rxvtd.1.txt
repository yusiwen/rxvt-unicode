NAME
    rxvtd - rxvt terminal daemon

SYNOPSIS
    rxvtd [-q|--quiet] [-o|--opendisplay] [-f|--fork]

DESCRIPTION
    This manpage describes the rxvtd daemon, which is the same vt102
    terminal emulator as rxvt, but runs as a daemon that can open multiple
    terminal windows within the same process.

    You can run it from your X startup scripts, for example, although it is
    not dependent on a working DISPLAY and, in fact, can open windows on
    multiple X displays on the same time.

    Advantages of running a rxvt daemon include faster creation time for
    terminal windows and a lot of saved memory.

    The disadvantage is a possible impact on stability - if the main program
    crashes, all processes in the terminal windows are terminated. For
    example, as there is no way to cleanly react to abnormal connection
    closes, "xkill" and server resets/restarts will kill the rxvtd instance
    including all windows it has opened.

OPTIONS
    rxvtd currently understands a few options only. Bundling of options is
    not yet supported.

    -q, --quiet
        Normally, rxvtd outputs the message "rxvt-unicode daemon listening
        on <path>" after binding to its control socket. This option will
        suppress this message (errors and warnings will still be logged).

    -o, --opendisplay
        This forces rxvtd to open a connection to the current $DISPLAY and
        keep it open.

        This is useful if you want to bind an instance of rxvtd to the
        lifetime of a specific display/server. If the server does a reset,
        rxvtd will be killed automatically.

    -f, --fork
        This makes rxvtd fork after it has bound itself to its control
        socket.

EXAMPLES
    This is a useful invocation of rxvtd in a .xsession-style script:

       B<rxvtd> -q -f -o

    This waits till the control socket is available, opens the current
    display and forks into the background. When you log-out, the server is
    reset and rxvtd is killed.

ENVIRONMENT
    RXVT_SOCKET
        Both rxvtc and rxvtd use the environment variable RXVT_SOCKET to
        create a listening socket and to contact the rxvtd, respectively. If
        the variable is missing, $HOME/.rxvt-unicode-*<nodename>* is used.

    DISPLAY
        Only used when the "--opendisplay" option is specified. Must contain
        a valid X display name.
