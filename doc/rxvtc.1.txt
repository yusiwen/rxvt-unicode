NAME
    rxvtc - control the rxvtd daemon

SYNOPSIS
    rxvtc [same options as for rxvt]

DESCRIPTION
    This manpage describes the rxvtc client program. It connects to the
    rxvtd daemon and requests a new terminal window. It takes the same
    arguments as the rxvt program. The environment will also be respected.
    Currently, it always returns immediately after contacting the daemon.

OPTIONS
    All options that are valid for rxvt are valid for rxvtc, too. Please
    note that all options are currently interpreted in the context of the
    daemon process, which makes a difference for options that specify a file
    descriptor (such as -pty-fd).

ENVIRONMENT
    All environment variables of the current process will be made available
    to the new instance, and will be interpreted as if rxvt were started
    directly.

    RXVT_SOCKET
        Both rxvtc and rxvtd use the environment variable RXVT_SOCKET to
        create a listening socket and to contact the rxvtd, respectively. If
        the variable is missing, $HOME/.rxvt-unicode-*<nodename>* is used.
        The variable must specify the absolute path of the socket to create.
