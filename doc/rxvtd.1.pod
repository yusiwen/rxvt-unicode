=head1 NAME

@@RXVT_NAME@@d - @@RXVT_NAME@@ terminal daemon

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> [-q|--quiet] [-o|--opendisplay] [-f|--fork]

B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> -q -o -f    # for .xsession use

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manpage describes the @@RXVT_NAME@@d daemon, which is the same vt102
terminal emulator as @@RXVT_NAME@@, but runs as a daemon that can open
multiple terminal windows within the same process.

You can run it from your X startup scripts, for example, although it is
not dependent on a working DISPLAY and, in fact, can open windows on
multiple X displays on the same time.

Advantages of running a @@RXVT_NAME@@ daemon include faster creation time
for terminal windows and a lot of saved memory.

The disadvantage is a possible impact on stability - if the
main program crashes, all processes in the terminal windows are
terminated. For example, as there is no way to cleanly react to abnormal
connection closes, C<xkill> and server resets/restarts will kill the
B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> instance including all windows it has opened.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> currently understands a few options only. Bundling of
options is not yet supported.

=over 4

=item B<-q>, B<--quiet>

Normally, B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> outputs the message C<< rxvt-unicode daemon
listening on <path> >> after binding to its control socket. This option
will suppress this message (errors and warnings will still be logged).

=item B<-o>, B<--opendisplay>

This forces B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> to open a connection to the current
C<$DISPLAY> and keep it open.

This is useful if you want to bind an instance of B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> to
the lifetime of a specific display/server. If the server does a reset,
B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> will be killed automatically.

=item B<-f>, B<--fork>

This makes B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> fork after it has bound itself to its control
socket.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

This is a useful invocation of B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> in a F<.xsession>-style
script:

   @@RXVT_NAME@@d -q -f -o

This waits till the control socket is available, opens the current display
and forks into the background. When you log-out, the server is reset and
B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> is killed.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over 4

=item B<RXVT_SOCKET>

Both B<@@RXVT_NAME@@c> and B<@@RXVT_NAME@@d> use the environment
variable F<RXVT_SOCKET> to create a listening socket and to contact
the @@RXVT_NAME@@d, respectively. If the variable is missing then
F<<< $HOME/.rxvt-unicode-I<< <nodename> >> >>> is used.

=item B<DISPLAY>

Only used when the C<--opendisplay> option is specified. Must contain a
valid X display name.
