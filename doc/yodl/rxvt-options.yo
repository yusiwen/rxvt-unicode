manpageoptions()

The bf(RXVTNAME()) options (mostly a subset of em(xterm)'s) are listed below.
In keeping with the smaller-is-better philosophy, options may be eliminated
or default values chosen at compile-time, so options and defaults listed
may not accurately reflect the version installed on your system.  
`rxvt -h' gives a list of major compile-time options on the em(Options) line.
Option descriptions may be prefixed with which compile option each is
dependent upon.  e.g. `Compile em(XIM):' requires em(XIM) on the em(Options)
line.  Note: `rxvt -help' gives a list of all command-line options compiled
into your version.

Note that bf(RXVTNAME()) permits the resource name to be used as a long-option
(--/++ option) so the potential command-line options are far greater than
those listed.
For example: `rxvt --loginShell --color1 Orange'.

The following options are available:

startdit()
    dit(bf(-help), bf(--help))
	Print out a message describing available options.
    dit(bf(-display) em(displayname))
	Attempt to open a window on the named X display (bf(-d) still
	respected).  In the absence of this option, the display specified
	by the bf(DISPLAY) environment variable is used.

	Window geometry (bf(-g) still respected);
        resource bf(geometry).

	Turn on/off jump scrolling;
        resource bf(jumpScroll).
    dit(bf(-ip)|bf(+ip))
	Turn on/off inheriting parent window's pixmap.  Alternative form

    dit(bf(-pixmap:) em(file[;geom]))
	Compile em(XPM): Specify XPM file for the background and also

	may need to add quotes to avoid special shell interpretation of
	the `;' in the command-line;
	resource bf(backgroundPixmap).
    dit(bf(-cr) em(colour))
	The cursor colour;
	resource bf(cursorColor).
    dit(bf(-pr) em(colour))

    dit(bf(-fn) em(fontname))
	Select the fonts to be used used. This is a comma seperated
        list of font names that are used in turn when trying to display
        unicode characters. The first font defines the cell size for characters,
        other fonts might be smaller, but not larger. A reasonable default font list
        is always appended to it.
	resource bf(font).
    dit(bf(-name) em(name))
	Specify the application name under which resources
	are to be obtained, rather than the default executable file name.
	Name should not contain `.' or `*' characters.
	Also sets the icon and title name.

	Start as a login-shell/sub-shell;
	resource bf(loginShell).

	Turn on/off scrollbar;
	resource bf(scrollBar).

	Turn on/off scroll-to-bottom on TTY output inhibit;
	resource bf(scrollTtyOutput) has opposite effect.
    dit(bf(-sk)|bf(+sk))
	Turn on/off scroll-to-bottom on keypress;
	resource bf(scrollTtyKeypress).
    dit(bf(-sw)|bf(+sw))

	Put scrollbar on right/left;
	resource bf(scrollBar_right).
    dit(bf(-st)|bf(+st)) 
	Display normal (non XTerm/NeXT) scrollbar without/with a trough;
	resource bf(scrollBar_floating).
    dit(bf(-bc)|bf(+bc))
	Blink the cursor; resource bf(cursorBlink).

	resource bf(saveLines).
    dit(bf(-b) em(number))
	Compile em(frills): Internal border of em(number) pixels.  See
	resource entry for limits;

	row of the display;
	resource bf(linespace).
    dit(bf(-tn) em(termname)) 
	This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the
	bf(TERM) environment variable. This terminal type must exist in the
	em(termcap(5)) database and should have em(li#) and em(co#) entries;
	resource bf(termName).
    dit(bf(-e) em(command [arguments]))
	Run the command with its command-line arguments in the bf(RXVTNAME())
	window; also sets the window title and icon name to be the basename
	of the program being executed if neither em(-title) (em(-T)) nor
	em(-n) are given on the command line.  If this option is used, it
	must be the last on the command-line.  If there is no bf(-e) option
	then the default is to run the program specified by the bf(SHELL)
	environment variable or, failing that, em(sh(1)).
    dit(bf(-title) em(text))
	Window title (bf(-T) still respected); the default title is the

        of e.g. de_DE.UTF-8 for normal text processing but ja_JP.EUC-JP
        for the input extension to be able to input japanese characters
        while staying in another locale.
    dit(bf(-insecure))
        Enable "insecure" mode, which currently enables most of the escape
        sequences that echo strings. See the resource bf(insecure) for
        more info.
    dit(bf(-mod) em(modifier))
	Override detection of Meta modifier with specified key:

    dit(bf(-xrm) em(resourcestring))
	No effect on rxvt.  Simply passes through an argument to be made
