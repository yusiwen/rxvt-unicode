	region and release; Right click to extend the marked region;
	Left double-click to select a word; Left triple-click to select
	the entire line.
    dit(bf(Insertion):)
	Pressing and releasing the Middle mouse button (or bf(Shift-Insert))
	in an bf(RXVTNAME()) window causes the current text selection to be inserted
	as if it had been typed on the keyboard.
enddit()
