\fII use Gentoo, and I have a problem...\fR
.IX Subsection "I use Gentoo, and I have a problem..."
.PP
There are three big problems with Gentoo Linux: first of all, most if not
all Gentoo systems are completely broken (missing or mismatched header
files, broken compiler etc. are just the tip of the iceberg); secondly,
the Gentoo maintainer thinks it is a good idea to add broken patches to
the code; and lastly, it should be called Gentoo GNU/Linux.
.PP
For these reasons, it is impossible to support rxvt-unicode on
Gentoo. Problems appearing on Gentoo systems will usually simply be
ignored unless they can be reproduced on non-Gentoo systems.
.PP
\fIDoes it support tabs, can I have a tabbed rxvt-unicode?\fR
.IX Subsection "Does it support tabs, can I have a tabbed rxvt-unicode?"
.PP
Beginning with version 7.3, there is a perl extension that implements a
simple tabbed terminal. It is installed by default, so any of these should
give you tabs:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   @@URXVT_NAME@@ \-pe tabbed
\&
\&   URxvt.perl\-ext\-common: default,tabbed
.Ve
.PP
It will also work fine with tabbing functionality of many window managers
or similar tabbing programs, and its embedding-features allow it to be
embedded into other programs, as witnessed by \fIdoc/rxvt\-tabbed\fR or
the upcoming \f(CW\*(C`Gtk2::URxvt\*(C'\fR perl module, which features a tabbed urxvt
(murxvt) terminal as an example embedding application.
.PP
\fIHow do I know which rxvt-unicode version I'm using?\fR
.IX Subsection "How do I know which rxvt-unicode version I'm using?"
.PP
The version number is displayed with the usage (\-h). Also the escape
sequence \f(CW\*(C`ESC [ 8 n\*(C'\fR sets the window title to the version number. When
using the @@URXVT_NAME@@c client, the version displayed is that of the
daemon.
.PP
\fIRxvt-unicode uses gobs of memory, how can I reduce that?\fR
.IX Subsection "Rxvt-unicode uses gobs of memory, how can I reduce that?"
.PP
Rxvt-unicode tries to obey the rule of not charging you for something you
don't use. One thing you should try is to configure out all settings that
you don't need, for example, Xft support is a resource hog by design,
when used. Compiling it out ensures that no Xft font will be loaded
accidentally when rxvt-unicode tries to find a font for your characters.
.PP
Also, many people (me included) like large windows and even larger
scrollback buffers: Without \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-unicode3\*(C'\fR, rxvt-unicode will use
6 bytes per screen cell. For a 160x?? window this amounts to almost a
kilobyte per line. A scrollback buffer of 10000 lines will then (if full)
use 10 Megabytes of memory. With \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-unicode3\*(C'\fR it gets worse, as
rxvt-unicode then uses 8 bytes per screen cell.
.PP
\fIHow can I start @@URXVT_NAME@@d in a race-free way?\fR

display, create the listening socket and then fork.

\fIHow can I start @@URXVT_NAME@@d automatically when I run @@URXVT_NAME@@c?\fR
.IX Subsection "How can I start @@URXVT_NAME@@d automatically when I run @@URXVT_NAME@@c?"
.PP
If you want to start @@URXVT_NAME@@d automatically whenever you run
@@URXVT_NAME@@c and the daemon isn't running yet, use this script:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&   #!/bin/sh
\&   @@URXVT_NAME@@c "$@"
\&   if [ $? \-eq 2 ]; then
\&      @@URXVT_NAME@@d \-q \-o \-f
\&      @@URXVT_NAME@@c "$@"
\&   fi
.Ve
.PP
This tries to create a new terminal, and if fails with exit status 2,
meaning it couldn't connect to the daemon, it will start the daemon and
re-run the command. Subsequent invocations of the script will re-use the
existing daemon.

.IX Subsection "How do I distinguish whether I'm running rxvt-unicode or a regular xterm? I need this to decide about setting colours etc."
.PP
The original rxvt and rxvt-unicode always export the variable \*(L"\s-1COLORTERM\*(R",\s0
so you can check and see if that is set. Note that several programs, \s-1JED,\s0
slrn, Midnight Commander automatically check this variable to decide
whether or not to use colour.
.PP
\fIHow do I set the correct, full \s-1IP\s0 address for the \s-1DISPLAY\s0 variable?\fR

.PP
If you've compiled rxvt-unicode with \s-1DISPLAY_IS_IP\s0 and have enabled
insecure mode then it is possible to use the following shell script
snippets to correctly set the display. If your version of rxvt-unicode
wasn't also compiled with \s-1ESCZ_ANSWER \s0(as assumed in these snippets) then
the \s-1COLORTERM\s0 variable can be used to distinguish rxvt-unicode from a
regular xterm.

\fIIsn't rxvt-unicode supposed to be small? Don't all those features bloat?\fR
.IX Subsection "Isn't rxvt-unicode supposed to be small? Don't all those features bloat?"
.PP
I often get asked about this, and I think, no, they didn't cause extra
bloat. If you compare a minimal rxvt and a minimal urxvt, you can see
that the urxvt binary is larger (due to some encoding tables always being
compiled in), but it actually uses less memory (\s-1RSS\s0) after startup. Even
with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-everything\*(C'\fR, this comparison is a bit unfair, as many
features unique to urxvt (locale, encoding conversion, iso14755 etc.) are
already in use in this mode.
.PP

.PP
When you \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-everything\*(C'\fR (which \fIis\fR unfair, as this involves xft
and full locale/XIM support which are quite bloaty inside libX11 and my
libc), the two diverge, but not unreasonably so.

.PP
The very large size of the text section is explained by the east-asian
encoding tables, which, if unused, take up disk space but nothing else
and can be compiled out unless you rely on X11 core fonts that use those
encodings. The \s-1BSS\s0 size comes from the 64k emergency buffer that my c++
compiler allocates (but of course doesn't use unless you are out of
memory). Also, using an xft font instead of a core font immediately adds a
few megabytes of \s-1RSS.\s0 Xft indeed is responsible for a lot of \s-1RSS\s0 even when
not used.
.PP
Of course, due to every character using two or four bytes instead of one,
a large scrollback buffer will ultimately make rxvt-unicode use more
memory.
.PP
Compared to e.g. Eterm (5112k), aterm (3132k) and xterm (4680k), this
still fares rather well. And compared to some monsters like gnome-terminal
(21152k + extra 4204k in separate processes) or konsole (22200k + extra
43180k in daemons that stay around after exit, plus half a minute of
startup time, including the hundreds of warnings it spits out), it fares
extremely well *g*.

\fIWhy \*(C+, isn't that unportable/bloated/uncool?\fR
.IX Subsection "Why , isn't that unportable/bloated/uncool?"
.PP
Is this a question? :) It comes up very often. The simple answer is: I had
to write it, and \*(C+ allowed me to write and maintain it in a fraction
of the time and effort (which is a scarce resource for me). Put even
shorter: It simply wouldn't exist without \*(C+.
.PP
My personal stance on this is that \*(C+ is less portable than C, but in
the case of rxvt-unicode this hardly matters, as its portability limits
are defined by things like X11, pseudo terminals, locale support and unix
domain sockets, which are all less portable than \*(C+ itself.
.PP
Regarding the bloat, see the above question: It's easy to write programs
in C that use gobs of memory, and certainly possible to write programs in
\&\*(C+ that don't. \*(C+ also often comes with large libraries, but this is
not necessarily the case with \s-1GCC.\s0 Here is what rxvt links against on my
system with a minimal config:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&   libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x00002aaaaabc3000)

.IX Subsection "Rendering, Font & Look and Feel Issues"
\fII can't get transparency working, what am I doing wrong?\fR
.IX Subsection "I can't get transparency working, what am I doing wrong?"
.PP
First of all, transparency isn't officially supported in rxvt-unicode, so
you are mostly on your own. Do not bug the author about it (but you may
bug everybody else). Also, if you can't get it working consider it a rite
of passage: ... and you failed.
.PP
Here are four ways to get transparency. \fBDo\fR read the manpage and option
descriptions for the programs mentioned and rxvt-unicode. Really, do it!
.PP
1. Use transparent mode:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   Esetroot wallpaper.jpg
\&   @@URXVT_NAME@@ \-tr \-tint red \-sh 40
.Ve
.PP
That works. If you think it doesn't, you lack transparency and tinting
support, or you are unable to read.
This method requires that the background-setting program sets the
_XROOTPMAP_ID or \s-1ESETROOT_PMAP_ID\s0 property. Compatible programs
are Esetroot, hsetroot and feh.
.PP
2. Use a simple pixmap and emulate pseudo-transparency. This enables you
to use effects other than tinting and shading: Just shade/tint/whatever
your picture with gimp or any other tool:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   convert wallpaper.jpg \-blur 20x20 \-modulate 30 background.jpg
\&   @@URXVT_NAME@@ \-pixmap "background.jpg;:root"
.Ve
.PP
That works. If you think it doesn't, you lack GDK-PixBuf support, or you
are unable to read.
.PP
3. Use an \s-1ARGB\s0 visual:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   @@URXVT_NAME@@ \-depth 32 \-fg grey90 \-bg rgba:0000/0000/4444/cccc
.Ve
.PP
This requires \s-1XFT\s0 support, and the support of your X\-server. If that
doesn't work for you, blame Xorg and Keith Packard. \s-1ARGB\s0 visuals aren't
there yet, no matter what they claim. Rxvt-Unicode contains the necessary
bugfixes and workarounds for Xft and Xlib to make it work, but that
doesn't mean that your \s-1WM\s0 has the required kludges in place.
.PP
4. Use xcompmgr and let it do the job:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  xprop \-frame \-f _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY 32c \e
\&        \-set _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY 0xc0000000
.Ve
.PP
Then click on a window you want to make transparent. Replace \f(CW0xc0000000\fR
by other values to change the degree of opacity. If it doesn't work and
your server crashes, you got to keep the pieces.
.PP
\fIWhy does rxvt-unicode sometimes leave pixel droppings?\fR
.IX Subsection "Why does rxvt-unicode sometimes leave pixel droppings?"
.PP
Most fonts were not designed for terminal use, which means that character
size varies a lot. A font that is otherwise fine for terminal use might
contain some characters that are simply too wide. Rxvt-unicode will avoid
these characters. For characters that are just \*(L"a bit\*(R" too wide a special
\&\*(L"careful\*(R" rendering mode is used that redraws adjacent characters.
.PP
All of this requires that fonts do not lie about character sizes,
however: Xft fonts often draw glyphs larger than their acclaimed bounding
box, and rxvt-unicode has no way of detecting this (the correct way is to
ask for the character bounding box, which unfortunately is wrong in these
cases).
.PP
It's not clear (to me at least), whether this is a bug in Xft, freetype,
or the respective font. If you encounter this problem you might try using
the \f(CW\*(C`\-lsp\*(C'\fR option to give the font more height. If that doesn't work, you
might be forced to use a different font.
.PP
All of this is not a problem when using X11 core fonts, as their bounding
box data is correct.
.PP
\fIHow can I keep rxvt-unicode from using reverse video so much?\fR
.IX Subsection "How can I keep rxvt-unicode from using reverse video so much?"
.PP
First of all, make sure you are running with the right terminal settings
(\f(CW\*(C`TERM=rxvt\-unicode\*(C'\fR), which will get rid of most of these effects. Then
make sure you have specified colours for italic and bold, as otherwise
rxvt-unicode might use reverse video to simulate the effect:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   URxvt.colorBD:  white
\&   URxvt.colorIT:  green
.Ve
.PP
\fISome programs assume totally weird colours (red instead of blue), how can I fix that?\fR
.IX Subsection "Some programs assume totally weird colours (red instead of blue), how can I fix that?"
.PP
For some unexplainable reason, some rare programs assume a very weird
colour palette when confronted with a terminal with more than the standard
8 colours (rxvt-unicode supports 88). The right fix is, of course, to fix
these programs not to assume non-ISO colours without very good reasons.
.PP
In the meantime, you can either edit your \f(CW\*(C`rxvt\-unicode\*(C'\fR terminfo
definition to only claim 8 colour support or use \f(CW\*(C`TERM=rxvt\*(C'\fR, which will
fix colours but keep you from using other rxvt-unicode features.
.PP
\fICan I switch the fonts at runtime?\fR
.IX Subsection "Can I switch the fonts at runtime?"
.PP
Yes, using an escape sequence. Try something like this, which has the same
effect as using the \f(CW\*(C`\-fn\*(C'\fR switch, and takes effect immediately:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   printf \*(Aq\e33]50;%s\e007\*(Aq "9x15bold,xft:Kochi Gothic"

\fIWhy do italic characters look as if clipped?\fR

.PP
Many fonts have difficulties with italic characters and hinting. For
example, the otherwise very nicely hinted font \f(CW\*(C`xft:Bitstream Vera Sans
Mono\*(C'\fR completely fails in its italic face. A workaround might be to
enable freetype autohinting, i.e. like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   URxvt.italicFont:        xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:italic:autohint=true

\fICan I speed up Xft rendering somehow?\fR
.IX Subsection "Can I speed up Xft rendering somehow?"
.PP
Yes, the most obvious way to speed it up is to avoid Xft entirely, as
it is simply slow. If you still want Xft fonts you might try to disable
antialiasing (by appending \f(CW\*(C`:antialias=false\*(C'\fR), which saves lots of
memory and also speeds up rendering considerably.
.PP
\fIRxvt-unicode doesn't seem to anti-alias its fonts, what is wrong?\fR
.IX Subsection "Rxvt-unicode doesn't seem to anti-alias its fonts, what is wrong?"
.PP
Rxvt-unicode will use whatever you specify as a font. If it needs to
fall back to its default font search list it will prefer X11 core
fonts, because they are small and fast, and then use Xft fonts. It has
antialiasing disabled for most of them, because the author thinks they
look best that way.

If you want antialiasing, you have to specify the fonts manually.

the text blink when compiled with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-text\-blink\*(C'\fR. Without

\fIHow does rxvt-unicode choose fonts?\fR
.IX Subsection "How does rxvt-unicode choose fonts?"
.PP
Most fonts do not contain the full range of Unicode, which is
fine. Chances are that the font you (or the admin/package maintainer of
your system/os) have specified does not cover all the characters you want
to display.
.PP
\&\fBrxvt-unicode\fR makes a best-effort try at finding a replacement
font. Often the result is fine, but sometimes the chosen font looks
bad/ugly/wrong. Some fonts have totally strange characters that don't
resemble the correct glyph at all, and rxvt-unicode lacks the artificial
intelligence to detect that a specific glyph is wrong: it has to believe
the font that the characters it claims to contain indeed look correct.
.PP
In that case, select a font of your taste and add it to the font list,
e.g.:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   @@URXVT_NAME@@ \-fn basefont,font2,font3...
.Ve
.PP
When rxvt-unicode sees a character, it will first look at the base
font. If the base font does not contain the character, it will go to the
next font, and so on. Specifying your own fonts will also speed up this
search and use less resources within rxvt-unicode and the X\-server.
.PP
The only limitation is that none of the fonts may be larger than the base
font, as the base font defines the terminal character cell size, which
must be the same due to the way terminals work.
.PP
\fIWhy do some chinese characters look so different than others?\fR
.IX Subsection "Why do some chinese characters look so different than others?"
.PP
This is because there is a difference between script and language \*(--
rxvt-unicode does not know which language the text that is output is,
as it only knows the unicode character codes. If rxvt-unicode first
sees a japanese/chinese character, it might choose a japanese font for
display. Subsequent japanese characters will use that font. Now, many
chinese characters aren't represented in japanese fonts, so when the first
non-japanese character comes up, rxvt-unicode will look for a chinese font
\&\*(-- unfortunately at this point, it will still use the japanese font for
chinese characters that are also in the japanese font.
.PP
The workaround is easy: just tag a chinese font at the end of your font
list (see the previous question). The key is to view the font list as
a preference list: If you expect more japanese, list a japanese font
first. If you expect more chinese, put a chinese font first.
.PP
In the future it might be possible to switch language preferences at
runtime (the internal data structure has no problem with using different
fonts for the same character at the same time, but no interface for this
has been designed yet).
.PP
Until then, you might get away with switching fonts at runtime (see \*(L"Can
I switch the fonts at runtime?\*(R" later in this document).

.IX Subsection "I don't like the new selection/popups/hotkeys/perl, how do I change/disable it?"
.PP
You can disable the perl extension completely by setting the
\&\fBperl-ext-common\fR resource to the empty string, which also keeps
rxvt-unicode from initialising perl, saving memory.
.PP
If you only want to disable specific features, you first have to
identify which perl extension is responsible. For this, read the section
\&\fB\s-1PREPACKAGED EXTENSIONS\s0\fR in the @@URXVT_NAME@@\fIperl\fR\|(3) manpage. For
example, to disable the \fBselection-popup\fR and \fBoption-popup\fR, specify
this \fBperl-ext-common\fR resource:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   URxvt.perl\-ext\-common: default,\-selection\-popup,\-option\-popup
.Ve
.PP
This will keep the default extensions, but disable the two popup
extensions. Some extensions can also be configured, for example,
scrollback search mode is triggered by \fBM\-s\fR. You can move it to any
other combination either by setting the \fBsearchable-scrollback\fR resource:

.IX Subsection "During rlogin/ssh/telnet/etc. sessions, clicking near the cursor outputs strange escape sequences, how do I fix this?"
.PP
These are caused by the \f(CW\*(C`readline\*(C'\fR perl extension. Under normal
circumstances, it will move your cursor around when you click into the
line that contains it. It tries hard not to do this at the wrong moment,
but when running a program that doesn't parse cursor movements or in some
cases during rlogin sessions, it fails to detect this properly.

Some Debian GNUL/Linux users seem to have this problem, although no

by the wrong \f(CW\*(C`TERM\*(C'\fR setting, although the details of whether and how

\fIMy Compose (Multi_key) key is no longer working.\fR
.IX Subsection "My Compose (Multi_key) key is no longer working."

The most common causes for this are that either your locale is not set

your input method. For example, if you specified \fBOverTheSpot\fR and
your input method (e.g. the default input method handling Compose keys)
does not support this (for instance because it is not visual), then
rxvt-unicode will continue without an input method.
.PP
In this case either do not specify a \fBpreeditType\fR or specify more than
one pre-edit style, such as \fBOverTheSpot,Root,None\fR.
.PP
If it still doesn't work, then maybe your input method doesn't support
compose sequences \- to fall back to the built-in one, make sure you don't
specify an input method via \f(CW\*(C`\-im\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`XMODIFIERS\*(C'\fR.

\fIWhat's with the strange Backspace/Delete key behaviour?\fR
.IX Subsection "What's with the strange Backspace/Delete key behaviour?"
.PP
Assuming that the physical Backspace key corresponds to the
Backspace keysym (not likely for Linux ... see the following
question) there are two standard values that can be used for
Backspace: \f(CW\*(C`^H\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`^?\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Historically, either value is correct, but rxvt-unicode adopts the debian
policy of using \f(CW\*(C`^?\*(C'\fR when unsure, because it's the one and only correct
choice :).
.PP
It is possible to toggle between \f(CW\*(C`^H\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`^?\*(C'\fR with the \s-1DECBKM\s0
private mode:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   # use Backspace = ^H
\&   $ stty erase ^H
\&   $ printf "\ee[?67h"
\&
\&   # use Backspace = ^?
\&   $ stty erase ^?
\&   $ printf "\ee[?67l"
.Ve
.PP
This helps satisfy some of the Backspace discrepancies that occur, but
if you use Backspace = \f(CW\*(C`^H\*(C'\fR, make sure that the termcap/terminfo value
properly reflects that.
.PP
The Delete key is a another casualty of the ill-defined Backspace problem.
To avoid confusion between the Backspace and Delete keys, the Delete
key has been assigned an escape sequence to match the vt100 for Execute
(\f(CW\*(C`ESC [ 3 ~\*(C'\fR) and is in the supplied termcap/terminfo.
.PP
Some other Backspace problems:
.PP
some editors use termcap/terminfo,
some editors (vim I'm told) expect Backspace = ^H,
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Emacs (and Emacs-like editors) use ^H for help.
.PP
Perhaps someday this will all be resolved in a consistent manner.

I wrote rxvt-unicode to be able to specify fonts exactly. So don't be

the version from XFree\-3.3, as XFree\-4 replaced it by a totally different
font (different glyphs for \f(CW\*(C`;\*(C'\fR and many other harmless characters),
while the second font is actually the \f(CW\*(C`9x15bold\*(C'\fR from XFree4/XOrg. The

\fIWhy doesn't rxvt-unicode read my resources?\fR
.IX Subsection "Why doesn't rxvt-unicode read my resources?"
.PP
Well, why, indeed? It does, in a way very similar to other X
applications. Most importantly, this means that if you or your \s-1OS\s0 loads
resources into the X display (the right way to do it), rxvt-unicode will
ignore any resource files in your home directory. It will only read
\&\fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.Xdefaults\fR when no resources are attached to the display.
.PP
If you have or use an \fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.Xresources\fR file, chances are that
resources are loaded into your X\-server. In this case, you have to
re-login after every change (or run \fIxrdb \-merge \f(CI$HOME\fI/.Xresources\fR).
.PP
Also consider the form resources have to use:

\fIWhen I log-in to another system it tells me about missing terminfo data?\fR
.IX Subsection "When I log-in to another system it tells me about missing terminfo data?"
.PP
The terminal description used by rxvt-unicode is not as widely available
as that for xterm, or even rxvt (for which the same problem often arises).
.PP
The correct solution for this problem is to install the terminfo, this can
be done by simply installing rxvt-unicode on the remote system as well
(in case you have a nice package manager ready), or you can install the
terminfo database manually like this (with ncurses infocmp. works as
user and root):
.PP
.Vb 2
\&   REMOTE=remotesystem.domain
\&   infocmp rxvt\-unicode | ssh $REMOTE "mkdir \-p .terminfo && cat >/tmp/ti && tic /tmp/ti"
.Ve
.PP
One some systems you might need to set \f(CW$TERMINFO\fR to the full path of
\&\fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.terminfo\fR for this to work. Debian systems have a broken tic
which will not be able to overwrite the existing rxvt-unicode terminfo
entry \- you might have to manually delete all traces of \fIrxvt\-unicode*\fR
from \fI/etc/terminfo\fR.
.PP
If you cannot or do not want to do this, then you can simply set
\&\f(CW\*(C`TERM=rxvt\*(C'\fR or even \f(CW\*(C`TERM=xterm\*(C'\fR, and live with the small number of
problems arising, which includes wrong keymapping, less and different
colours and some refresh errors in fullscreen applications. It's a nice
quick-and-dirty workaround for rare cases, though.
.PP
If you always want to do this (and are fine with the consequences) you
can either recompile rxvt-unicode with the desired \s-1TERM\s0 value or use a
resource to set it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   URxvt.termName: rxvt
.Ve
.PP
If you don't plan to use \fBrxvt\fR (quite common...) you could also replace

One reason you might want this is that some distributions or operating

for \f(CW\*(C`rxvt\-unicode\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You could use rxvt's termcap entry with reasonable results in many cases.
You can also create a termcap entry by using terminfo's infocmp program
like this:

Or you could use the termcap entry in doc/etc/rxvt\-unicode.termcap,

.PP
If you encounter strange problems like typing an accented character but
getting two unrelated other characters or similar, or if program output is
subtly garbled, then you should check your locale settings.
.PP
Rxvt-unicode must be started with the same \f(CW\*(C`LC_CTYPE\*(C'\fR setting as the
programs running in it. Often rxvt-unicode is started in the \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR locale,
while the login script running within the rxvt-unicode window changes the
locale to something else, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`en_GB.UTF\-8\*(C'\fR. Needless to say, this is
not going to work, and is the most common cause for problems.
.PP
The best thing is to fix your startup environment, as you will likely run
into other problems. If nothing works you can try this in your .profile.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  printf \*(Aq\e33]701;%s\e007\*(Aq "$LC_CTYPE"   # $LANG or $LC_ALL are worth a try, too
.Ve
.PP
If this doesn't work, then maybe you use a \f(CW\*(C`LC_CTYPE\*(C'\fR specification not
supported on your systems. Some systems have a \f(CW\*(C`locale\*(C'\fR command which
displays this (also, \f(CW\*(C`perl \-e0\*(C'\fR can be used to check locale settings, as
it will complain loudly if it cannot set the locale). If it displays something
like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: ...
.Ve
.PP
Then the locale you specified is not supported on your system.
.PP
If nothing works and you are sure that everything is set correctly then
you will need to remember a little known fact: Some programs just don't
support locales :(

.PP
See next entry.
.PP
\fIIs there an option to switch encodings?\fR
.IX Subsection "Is there an option to switch encodings?"
.PP
Unlike some other terminals, rxvt-unicode has no encoding switch, and no
specific \*(L"utf\-8\*(R" mode, such as xterm. In fact, it doesn't even know about
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 or any other encodings with respect to terminal I/O.
.PP
The reasons is that there exists a perfectly fine mechanism for selecting
the encoding, doing I/O and (most important) communicating this to all
applications so everybody agrees on character properties such as width
and code number. This mechanism is the \fIlocale\fR. Applications not using
that info will have problems (for example, \f(CW\*(C`xterm\*(C'\fR gets the width of
characters wrong as it uses its own, locale-independent table under all
locales).
.PP
Rxvt-unicode uses the \f(CW\*(C`LC_CTYPE\*(C'\fR locale category to select encoding. All
programs doing the same (that is, most) will automatically agree in the
interpretation of characters.
.PP
Unfortunately, there is no system-independent way to select locales, nor
is there a standard on how locale specifiers will look like.
.PP
On most systems, the content of the \f(CW\*(C`LC_CTYPE\*(C'\fR environment variable
contains an arbitrary string which corresponds to an already-installed
locale. Common names for locales are \f(CW\*(C`en_US.UTF\-8\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`de_DE.ISO\-8859\-15\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`ja_JP.EUC\-JP\*(C'\fR, i.e. \f(CW\*(C`language_country.encoding\*(C'\fR, but other forms
(i.e. \f(CW\*(C`de\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`german\*(C'\fR) are also common.
.PP
Rxvt-unicode ignores all other locale categories, and except for
the encoding, ignores country or language-specific settings,
i.e. \f(CW\*(C`de_DE.UTF\-8\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ja_JP.UTF\-8\*(C'\fR are the normally same to
rxvt-unicode.
.PP
If you want to use a specific encoding you have to make sure you start
rxvt-unicode with the correct \f(CW\*(C`LC_CTYPE\*(C'\fR category.
.PP
\fICan I switch locales at runtime?\fR
.IX Subsection "Can I switch locales at runtime?"
.PP
Yes, using an escape sequence. Try something like this, which sets

.PP
.Vb 1

.PP
See also the previous answer.
.PP
Sometimes this capability is rather handy when you want to work in
one locale (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`de_DE.UTF\-8\*(C'\fR) but some programs don't support it
(e.g. \s-1UTF\-8\s0). For example, I use this script to start \f(CW\*(C`xjdic\*(C'\fR, which
first switches to a locale supported by xjdic and back later:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   printf \*(Aq\e33]701;%s\e007\*(Aq ja_JP.SJIS
\&   xjdic \-js
\&   printf \*(Aq\e33]701;%s\e007\*(Aq de_DE.UTF\-8

You can also use xterm's \f(CW\*(C`luit\*(C'\fR program, which usually works fine, except
for some locales where character width differs between program\- and
rxvt-unicode-locales.

For example, \fBkinput2\fR does not support \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locales, you should use

.IP "\- Make sure your \s-1XIM\s0 server is actually running." 4

When you want to use e.g. \fBkinput2\fR, it must be set to
\&\f(CW\*(C`@im=kinput2\*(C'\fR. For \fBscim\fR, use \f(CW\*(C`@im=SCIM\*(C'\fR. You can see what input
method servers are running with this command:

\fIMy input method wants <some encoding> but I want \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 what can I do?\fR

.PP

Now you can start your terminal with \f(CW\*(C`LC_CTYPE=ja_JP.UTF\-8\*(C'\fR and still
use your input method. Please note, however, that, depending on your Xlib
version, you may not be able to input characters outside \f(CW\*(C`EUC\-JP\*(C'\fR in a
normal way then, as your input method limits you.

Unfortunately, this is unavoidable, as the \s-1XIM\s0 protocol is racy by
design. Applications can avoid some crashes at the expense of memory
leaks, and Input Methods can avoid some crashes by careful ordering at
exit time. \fBkinput2\fR (and derived input methods) generally succeeds,
while \fB\s-1SCIM\s0\fR (or similar input methods) fails. In the end, however,
crashes cannot be completely avoided even if both sides cooperate.

You should build one binary with the default options. \fIconfigure\fR
now enables most useful options, and the trend goes to making them
runtime-switchable, too, so there is usually no drawback to enabling them,
except higher disk and possibly memory usage. The perl interpreter should
be enabled, as important functionality (menus, selection, likely more in
the future) depends on it.
.PP
You should not overwrite the \f(CW\*(C`perl\-ext\-common\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`perl\-ext\*(C'\fR resources
system-wide (except maybe with \f(CW\*(C`defaults\*(C'\fR). This will result in useful
behaviour. If your distribution aims at low memory, add an empty
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl\-ext\-common\*(C'\fR resource to the app-defaults file. This will keep the
perl interpreter disabled until the user enables it.
.PP
If you can/want build more binaries, I recommend building a minimal
one with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-everything\*(C'\fR (very useful) and a maximal one with

It should be, starting with release 7.1. You are encouraged to properly
install urxvt with privileges necessary for your \s-1OS\s0 now.
.PP
When rxvt-unicode detects that it runs setuid or setgid, it will fork
into a helper process for privileged operations (pty handling on some
systems, utmp/wtmp/lastlog handling on others) and drop privileges
immediately. This is much safer than most other terminals that keep
privileges while running (but is more relevant to urxvt, as it contains
things as perl interpreters, which might be \*(L"helpful\*(R" to attackers).
.PP
This forking is done as the very first within \fImain()\fR, which is very early
and reduces possible bugs to initialisation code run before \fImain()\fR, or
things like the dynamic loader of your system, which should result in very
little risk.
.PP
\fII am on FreeBSD and rxvt-unicode does not seem to work at all.\fR

.PP
Rxvt-unicode requires the symbol \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STDC_ISO_10646_\|_\*(C'\fR to be defined
in your compile environment, or an implementation that implements it,
whether it defines the symbol or not. \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STDC_ISO_10646_\|_\*(C'\fR requires that
\&\fBwchar_t\fR is represented as unicode.
.PP
As you might have guessed, FreeBSD does neither define this symbol nor
does it support it. Instead, it uses its own internal representation of
\&\fBwchar_t\fR. This is, of course, completely fine with respect to standards.
.PP
However, that means rxvt-unicode only works in \f(CW\*(C`POSIX\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ISO\-8859\-1\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`UTF\-8\*(C'\fR locales under FreeBSD (which all use Unicode as \fBwchar_t\fR).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_STDC_ISO_10646_\|_\*(C'\fR is the only sane way to support multi-language
apps in an \s-1OS,\s0 as using a locale-dependent (and non-standardized)
representation of \fBwchar_t\fR makes it impossible to convert between
\&\fBwchar_t\fR (as used by X11 and your applications) and any other encoding
without implementing OS-specific-wrappers for each and every locale. There
simply are no APIs to convert \fBwchar_t\fR into anything except the current
locale encoding.
.PP
Some applications (such as the formidable \fBmlterm\fR) work around this
by carrying their own replacement functions for character set handling
with them, and either implementing OS-dependent hacks or doing multiple
conversions (which is slow and unreliable in case the \s-1OS\s0 implements
encodings slightly different than the terminal emulator).
.PP
The rxvt-unicode author insists that the right way to fix this is in the
system libraries once and for all, instead of forcing every app to carry
complete replacements for them :)

rxvt-unicode should compile and run out of the box on cygwin, using

At the time of this writing, cygwin didn't seem to support any multi-byte

and Darwin 8, where combining chars are reported having width 1.

Changes all mouse reporting codes to use decimal parameters instead of
octets or characters.
.Sp
This mode should be enabled \fIbefore\fR actually enabling mouse reporting,
for semi-obvious reasons.
.Sp
The sequences received for various modes are as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&   ESC [ M o o o    !1005, !1015 (three octets)
\&   ESC [ M c c c    1005, !1015 (three characters)
\&   ESC [ Pm M       1015 (three or more numeric parameters)
.Ve
.Sp
The first three parameters are \f(CW\*(C`code\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR. Code is the numeric
code as for the other modes (but encoded as a decimal number, including
the additional offset of 32, so you have to subtract 32 first), \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR are the coordinates (1|1 is the upper left corner, just as with
cursor positioning).
.Sp
Example: Shift\-Button\-1 press at top row, column 80.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   ESC [ 37 ; 80 ; 1 M
.Ve
.Sp
One can use this feature by simply enabling it and then looking for
parameters to the \f(CW\*(C`ESC [ M\*(C'\fR reply \- if there are any, this mode is
active, otherwise one of the old reporting styles is used.
.Sp
Other (to be implemented) reply sequences will use a similar encoding.

composite characters. This is required for proper viewing of text
where accents are encoded as separate unicode characters. This is
done by using precomposed characters when available or creating
new pseudo-characters when no precomposed form exists.
.Sp
Without \-\-enable\-unicode3, the number of additional precomposed
characters is somewhat limited (the 6400 private use characters will be
(ab\-)used). With \-\-enable\-unicode3, no practical limit exists.
.Sp
This option will also enable storage (but not display) of characters
beyond plane 0 (>65535) when \-\-enable\-unicode3 was not specified.
.Sp
The combining table also contains entries for arabic presentation forms,
but these are not currently used. Bug me if you want these to be used (and
tell me how these are to be used...).

option requires \-\-enable\-utmp to also be specified.
.IP "\-\-enable\-lastlog (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-lastlog (default: on)"
Write user and tty to lastlog file (used by programs like
\&\fIlastlogin\fR) at start of rxvt execution.  This option requires
\&\-\-enable\-utmp to also be specified.
.IP "\-\-enable\-pixbuf (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-pixbuf (default: on)"
Add support for GDK-PixBuf to be used for background images.
It adds support for many file formats including \s-1JPG, PNG,
TIFF, GIF, XPM, BMP, ICO\s0 and \s-1TGA.\s0
.IP "\-\-enable\-startup\-notification (default: on)" 4

.IP "\-\-enable\-transparency (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-transparency (default: on)"
Add support for using the root pixmap as background to simulate transparency.
Note that this feature depends on libXrender and on the availability

.IP "\-\-enable\-frills (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-frills (default: on)"
Add support for many small features that are not essential but nice to
have. Normally you want this, but for very small binaries you may want to
disable this.
.Sp
A non-exhaustive list of features enabled by \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-frills\*(C'\fR (possibly
in combination with other switches) is:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&  MWM\-hints
\&  EWMH\-hints (pid, utf8 names) and protocols (ping)
\&  urgency hint
\&  separate underline colour (\-underlineColor)
\&  settable border widths and borderless switch (\-w, \-b, \-bl)
\&  visual depth selection (\-depth)
\&  settable extra linespacing (\-lsp)
\&  iso\-14755 5.1 (basic) support

.Sp
.Vb 11
\&  some round\-trip time optimisations
\&  nearest colour allocation on pseudocolor screens
\&  UTF8_STRING support for selection
\&  sgr modes 90..97 and 100..107
\&  backindex and forwardindex escape sequences
\&  view change/zero scrollback escape sequences
\&  locale switching escape sequence
\&  window op and some xterm/OSC escape sequences
\&  rectangular selections
\&  trailing space removal for selections
\&  verbose X error handling
.Ve
.IP "\-\-enable\-iso14755 (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-iso14755 (default: on)"
Enable extended \s-1ISO 14755\s0 support (see @@RXVT_NAME@@(1)).
Basic support (section 5.1) is enabled by \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-frills\*(C'\fR, while
support for 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 is enabled with this switch.
.IP "\-\-enable\-keepscrolling (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-keepscrolling (default: on)"
Add support for continual scrolling of the display when you hold
the mouse button down on a scrollbar arrow.
.IP "\-\-enable\-selectionscrolling (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-selectionscrolling (default: on)"
Add support for scrolling when the selection moves to the top or
bottom of the screen.
.IP "\-\-enable\-mousewheel (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-mousewheel (default: on)"
Add support for scrolling via mouse wheel or buttons 4 & 5.
.IP "\-\-enable\-slipwheeling (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-slipwheeling (default: on)"
Add support for continual scrolling (using the mouse wheel as an
accelerator) while the control key is held down.  This option
requires \-\-enable\-mousewheel to also be specified.
.IP "\-\-enable\-smart\-resize (default: off)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-smart-resize (default: off)"
Add smart growth/shrink behaviour when resizing.
This should keep the window corner which is closest to a corner of
the screen in a fixed position.
.IP "\-\-enable\-text\-blink (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-text-blink (default: on)"
Add support for blinking text.
.IP "\-\-enable\-pointer\-blank (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-pointer-blank (default: on)"
Add support to have the pointer disappear when typing or inactive.
.IP "\-\-enable\-perl (default: on)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-perl (default: on)"
Enable an embedded perl interpreter. See the \fB@@RXVT_NAME@@\f(BIperl\fB\|(3)\fR
manpage for more info on this feature, or the files in \fIsrc/perl/\fR
for the extensions that are installed by default.
The perl interpreter that is used can be specified via the \f(CW\*(C`PERL\*(C'\fR
environment variable when running configure. Even when compiled in,
perl will \fInot\fR be initialised when all extensions have been disabled
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-pe "" \-\-perl\-ext\-common ""\*(C'\fR, so it should be safe to enable from a
resource standpoint.
.IP "\-\-enable\-assert (default: off)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-assert (default: off)"
Enables the assertions in the code, normally disabled. This switch is only
useful when developing rxvt-unicode.
.IP "\-\-enable\-256\-color (default: off)" 4
.IX Item "--enable-256-color (default: off)"
Force use of so-called 256 colour mode, to work around buggy applications
that do not support termcap/terminfo, or simply improve support for
applications hardcoding the xterm 256 colour table.
.Sp
This switch breaks termcap/terminfo compatibility to \f(CW\*(C`TERM=rxvt\-unicode\*(C'\fR,
and consequently sets \f(CW\*(C`TERM\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`rxvt\-unicode\-256color\*(C'\fR by default
(\fIdoc/etc/\fR contains termcap/terminfo definitions for both).
.Sp
It also results in higher memory usage and can slow down @@RXVT_NAME@@
dramatically when more than six fonts are in use by a terminal instance.
.IP "\-\-with\-name=NAME (default: urxvt)" 4
.IX Item "--with-name=NAME (default: urxvt)"
Set the basename for the installed binaries, resulting
in \f(CW\*(C`urxvt\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`urxvtd\*(C'\fR etc.). Specify \f(CW\*(C`\-\-with\-name=rxvt\*(C'\fR to replace with
\&\f(CW\*(C`rxvt\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\-\-with\-term=NAME (default: rxvt-unicode)" 4
.IX Item "--with-term=NAME (default: rxvt-unicode)"
Change the environmental variable for the terminal to \s-1NAME.\s0
.IP "\-\-with\-terminfo=PATH" 4
.IX Item "--with-terminfo=PATH"
Change the environmental variable for the path to the terminfo tree to
\&\s-1PATH.\s0
.IP "\-\-with\-x" 4
.IX Item "--with-x"
Use the X Window System (pretty much default, eh?).
