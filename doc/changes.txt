2.21a3 to 2.21b*
\---------------
     1. From: Conrad Link <conrad@akira.resnet.rochester.edu>
	Fixed a bug in the OffiX Drag and Drop support.
	rxvt inserted two instances of directories or links when they 
	were dropped onto rxvt.
	
     2. From: <aner@zenith.att.com>
	Fixed a bug that makes rxvt getting constantly "NoExpose" events
	which it is not handling.

     3. From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Fixed a bug that caused rxvt to hang indefinitly waiting for a 
	terminating ^G on an XTerm `ESC]' sequence.

     4. From: Bernard PERROT <perrot@lal.in2p3.fr>
	      Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Fixed a bug that prevented to handle DEC VT2xx's ApLineDel correctly

     5. From: <vikas@insight.att.com>
	      Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Now the Shift/Ctrl cursor key mappings are enabled regardless of
	App-Cursor settings

     6. From: Kai Petzke <wpp@mail.physik.TU-Berlin.DE>
	Fixed a bug with respect to cursor movement. rxvt now handles the
	'G' and 'd' sequences correctly

     7. From: Geoff Wing <mason@primenet.com.au>
	Fixed a couple of things in utmp.c 

     8. From: Denis N. Antonioli <antonio@ifi.unizh.ch>
	Added the "-tn" option and corresponding Xresource variable "termcap".
	This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the
	TERM environment variable. 

2.20 to 2.21a*
\-------------
     1.	Oops, forgot to include time headers in menubar.c

     2.	Finally got the correct DEC sequence to toggling the behaviour
	of the backspace key and removed the other non-standard ones.
	If anyone has a listing of DEC escape sequences they'd like to
	donate ...

     3.	Fixed a bug that prevented an XPM file from being found if it
	were specified with an absolute path and a geometry string.
	Made the default scaling zero (tiled) since this is by far the
	most popular use.

     4.	The Motif-style scrollbar is back as a compile-time option.

     5.	Added BUGS file and (thankfully) moved coordination of the
	project to Oezguer Kesim <kesim@math.fu-berlin.de> who also
	has a mailing list for rxvt development

	Rxvt Workers <rxvt-workers@math.fu-berlin.de>

	To subscribe to the list send email to
	<rxvt@math.fu-berlin.de> with the body: subscribe

     6.	Semi-retirement and finish my thesis ... bye for now - /mark

   --- Oezguer started working on rxvt

     7. Fixed a bug in the new menubar-feature. There were several unchecked
	strings strcpy'ed which caused rxvt immediately to dump core.

     8. From: Robert Bihlmeyer <robbe@orcus.priv.at>
        Fixed a bug in rclock.c which prevented it to compile correctly.

     9. From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
        Overstrike boldfonts and pixmaps now work together without pixel
        droppings on the screen (at least under Linux).

    10. From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Modified autoconf support: memmove() replacement function
	supplied for those systems that need it, libXpm should now be
	correctly found (set in src/Makefile *not* in config.h)

    11.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Converted doc/rxvt.ref to HTML format.
		doc/html/refer.html = master copy
		doc/refer.txt  = text version saved using Netscape.

	All HTML documents are put in here, to ease installation
	elsewhere.

    12.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Moved some file search function from main.c and some string
	functions from xdefaults.c to misc.c.

	Changed the implementation details so that `keysym' resource
	is also available as a command-line long option ... even if
	you have compiled with USE_XGETDEFAULT.

    13.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	When a new pixmap is loaded, revert to the default scaling.

    14.	From: Mark Olesen <olesen@weber.me.queensu.ca>
	Reworked the menubar to permit multiple menubars in a circular
	linked list (and all the management functions that entains)
	and new functions including the following:

		* reading from files
		* dumping all the menubars
		* clearing a menu (without removing it)
		* setting a backgroudPixmap
		* and many other features.

	The menu syntax has changed very slightly from the last
	version, but now provides greater flexibility ... see
	refer.html for details.

	Added the `menu' resource/long-option so a startup menu
	can be specified. eg,
		rxvt -menu my.menu -e rlogin machine -l user

2.19 to 2.20
\-----------
     1.	You can now add snazzy looking menus to any plain (non-X) text
	application.  At the moment, the menuing system is simple but
	functional.

	The syntax for controlling the menubar is documented in
	doc/rxvt.doc, but note that an XTerm sequence `ESC ] 10; Pt
	BEL' is used so menus created for rxvt will be ignored by an
	ordinary XTerm.

	It provides sub-menus, click-and-drag, and even some user
	definable `quick' arrows keys.  However menu manipulation
	could use refinement to permit multiple menus to be defined --
	and the menu refreshing could also use some improvement, but
	it can be extended and refined later as required/desired.

	The files doc/menu.sh and doc/jedmenu.sl show sample
	implementations of menus.

	  -->	It compiles and runs on my machine (AIX 3.2.5)
		but THIS IS CONSIDERED BETA (or even ALPHA) CODE!

     2.	DEC private modes: Bug fix for 's'ave and 'r'estore parameters,
	added a 't'oggle parameter to DEC private modes.

     3.	Made Backspace key selectable with DEC private mode
	ESC [ ? 36 h/l/s/r/t (high/low/save/restore/toggle)

     4.	Changed the way the scrollBar is realized to permit on-the-fly
	toggling of the scrollBar display and added a DEC private mode
	escape sequence for that.  Smoother redraw of scrollBar.
	Better proportions for the arrows allows a slightly narrower
	scrollBar.

     5.	Added support for XTerm font changing sequence:
	`ESC ] 50; Pt BEL', with (as usual) a few extras.
	See doc/rxvt.ref

     6.	Adapted experimental XPM buffering from that supplied by
	Carsten Haitzler <raster@zip.com.au>.

     7.	Replaced `wait' with `waitpid' in src/command.c::Child_signal
	to avoid a race condition and permit use of pclose() on SunOS.
	Patch provided by <davis@space.mit.edu>, Thanks John!

     8.	For easier XPM handling, added `path' resource/long-option and
	substantially enhanced pixmap scaling to provide very exact
	control over scaling and positioning of the XPM background
	image.  The XPM XTerm escape sequence has been extended to
	provide a convenient facility for on-the-fly rescaling.
	Export COLORTERM="rxvt-xpm" instead of COLORTERM="rxvt"

     9.	Added export COLORFGBG to give hints to color applications.
	Typically one of these values is exported, in which `fg' and
	`bg' are numbers 00-15:

	COLORFGBG="default;default"
		-fg -bg colors don't match any of color 0-15

	COLORFGBG="fg;default"
		-fg color matches color 0-15, but -bg color doesn't

	COLORFGBG="default;bg"
		-bg color matches color 0-15, but -fg color doesn't

	COLORFGBG="fg;bg"
		-fg -bg colors match color 0-15

	When compiled with XPM support, the last two values are
	rendered as follows:

	COLORFGBG="default;default;bg"
		-bg color matches color 0-15, but -fg color doesn't

	COLORFGBG="fg;default;bg"
		-fg -bg colors match color 0-15

    10.	Disable Shift+Prior/Next and scrollBar if saveLines == 0.
	Slight change to key-processing so `shift+meta+key' and
	`shift+ctrl+key' gets processed as `shift+key'.  This provides
	a way to avoid interpretating `Shift+Prior', `Shift+Next', and
	`Shift+Insert'.

	Also, added DEC private mode sequence `ESC [ ? 35 h/l/s/r/t'
	to disable Shift+key interpretation.

	Provide for Ctrl+Shift+<KEY> combinations for function keys.
	See doc/rxvt.ref

    11.	Always match long-option names, even when only preceded by a
	single -/+.

2.18 to 2.19
\-----------
     1.	Minor alteration to input mode for Kanji processing.

     2.	rclock: -adjust option, support for exec on startup syntax,
	date format may now also include the century

     3.	Made mouse double-click respect autowrap lines.

     4.	Added marks for folded editing.

     5.	Added Offix DND (Drag 'n' Drop) protocol.
	Added support for XA_TARGETS.

     6.	added Carsten Haitzler <raster@zip.com.au> XPM patches to load
	an XPM file for the background of the terminal window.
	Uses resource `Rxvt.backgroundPixmap' or long-option
	`--backgroundPixmap'

     7.	Use these (XTerm) keybindings exclusively and remove the old
	equivalent bindings:
		Shift-Prior  = scroll up
		Shift-Next   = scroll down
		Shift-Insert = paste mouse selection

		Shift-KP_Add      = bigger font
		Shift-KP_Subtract = smaller font

2.17 to 2.18
\-----------
     1.	Check for NULL pointers in command-line processing (oops)
	Also fixed processing of `hidden' arguments such as -d, -g, -T

     2.	Fixed terminfo hpa/vpa: was `\E..' instead of `\E[..'
	added invisible cursor (ESC[?25h / ESC[?25l)

     3.	Fixed broken kanji characters (?? and disappeared cursor box ??)
	thanks to <manabe@Roy.dsl.tutics.tut.ac.jp>

     4.	In privileges(), changed setuid/setgid to seteuid/seteguid so that
	it's possible to switch back to root later.

	Perhaps fixed svr4 problems (reports no tty, no job control) in
	get_tty() ... need to detect these SVR4 features in the configure
	script.

     5.	Restored scrollColor, topShadowColor, bottomShadowColor resources
	that somehow got lost between the beta and release versions.  For
	monochrome displays, fixed scrollbar so it will be visible and
	suppress color changes.

     6.	Final? iteration on selection.  Store selection text with LF
	line-endings but paste into rxvt with CR endings.  Selection now
	preserves the newline when trailing space is stripped from
	non-autowrap lines.  Compile-time support for using a keystroke to
	paste from the cut-buffer.

     7.	Fixed utmp.c to handle both sysv and bsd pty names.  More changes in
	the works to improve documentation and eliminate race conditions ...
	this, thankfully, is being done by someone else.

     8.	Added European language support (X11R6) - let me know of problems
	and fixes since I only have X11R5.

     9.	Changed names of color10-color17 to color8-color15 to match with
	those used by color_xterm ... sorry for the inconvenience, but I
	didn't have an X11R6 xterm manpage until now and long-term
	compatibility is quite important.

	Added a real bold font (define USE_BOLDFONT).  I still think it's
	too much work to avoid pixel droppings for overstrike fonts.
	Added support for specifying colors for bold/underline
	(colorBD/colorUL) but it's only done when the foreground = the default
	foreground ... see the manpage.

	Compile-time selection of TERM="xterm-color".

	Reduced the number of rarely-used command-line options since they
	are accessible on the command-line via their resource names as long
	options.  More rigid differentiation between long and short options:
	long options are --/++ prefixed; short options -/+ prefixed.  Added
	long-option help to give the resource names.
	Removed run-time selection of right-hand scrollbar and arrows.
	Removed run-time selection of (pageup_key/pagedown_key/alert_key).

    10.	Changed Ctrl-Up,Down,Left,Right to emit "\EOa,b,c,d" instead of the
	previous "\E[^A,^B,^C,^D" to avoid problems associated with having
	an embedded "^C" in a key-sequence.  Disallow 80/132 column
	switching as the default (same as xterm).

    11.	Check for seteuid().  Add "ttcompat" module for SVR4.

    12.	A few people suggested removing the keystroke for toggling MapAlert
	and so I have.  I agree that it was pointless and/or annoying since
	there was no way of determining the current toggled state anyhow.

    13.	Fixed missing `ttydev' for _sgi.  Fixes for BSD utmp support.
	Exported WINDOWID before the window was created (oops).

    14.	Mouse cut&paste of autowrapped lines should be improved, fixed
	bug in screen.c::scroll_text().

    15.	As was pointed by a user -->> in keeping with X conventions, only an
	application that starts with 'x' should capitalize the first two
	letters of the resource file, so the rxvt resource file (and class
	name) should be named Rxvt not RXvt, this is a minor point.

    16.	rclock: As well as message reminders, rclock can launch programs and
	(if no message text is given) act as a cron-type of program.  Made
	default font `7x14'.  Fixed graphics context when mail is waiting
	and a reminder is issued - so the message is actually visible!

    17.	As suggested by a user, changed the bolding algorithm to be slightly
	more intuitive:
		1. colorBD (if specified)
		2. color0-7 -> color8-15 (if possible)
		3. boldFont (if specified and found)
		4. overstrike (last resort)

	This takes advantage of the color capability and is the most
	consistent when toggling font sizes on-the-fly.  If you never want
	overstrike (looks ugly and leaves pixel droppings) or boldFont (you
	like to switch font sizes on-the-fly), you can remove them at
	compile-time.  The other elements are similarly compile-time
	selectable.

    18.	Another user suggestion: scrollbar made more distinct by having the
	`trough' a different color from the slider -- I opted for making it
	the same as the default background color so that the slider and
	arrows appear to `float' on the window.  Also removed topShadowColor,
	bottomShadowColor resources as unnecessary.

    19.	Dropped distribution of vttest since Tom Dickey <dickey@clark.net>
	is working on an improved version.

2.16 to 2.17
\-----------
     1.	Fixed problem in scr_refesh_region() that was introduced in v2.16
	The problem of `pixel droppings' continues when bold is simulated
	using overstrike.  Using XCopyArea() sometimes helps, but the
	preferred and simplest solution is item 4 below.

    2.	Removed 7bit mode.

	Changed definition of meta so that the ESCAPE is the default and
	using meta to set the 8bit on an option that can be made run-time
	configurable (assuming people still use this).

	Added -/+rv command-line option, resource reverseVideo.  NB: it works
	slightly differently from xterm's in that foreground/background are
	swapped even if they have been explicitly set.

	Removed NO_COLOR option -- no more monochrome rxvt (one too #ifdef's).

	Inherit existing stty settings (at least for control characters)
	and set value of BackSpace appropriately.

	Added defines DONT_GUESS_BACKSPACE and NO_DELETE_KEY

    3.	Added 3D style scrollbar and removed all the old bitmapped
	scrollbars and arrows with the only exception being the xterm
	lookalike XTERM_SCROLLBAR which is available in a single width.
	With arrows, scrollbar behaviour somewhat resembles Motif
	behaviour.  Without arrows, it's the standard xterm behaviour.

	The default scrollbar (defined at compile-time or set by using
	scrollBar: True) is to have a scrollbar with arrows arranged on the
	right-hand side. The scrollBar resource is now exclusively a boolean
	value

	scrollbar resources:

		scrollColor
		topShadowColor
		bottomShadowColor

	NB: if topShadowColor/bottomShadowColor are unset, their values are
	    calculated from scrollColor using an algorithm adapted from
	    fvwm so it shouldn't be too hard to find scrollbar colours that
	    look good with your window manager and don't consume an entire
	    colormap.

    4.	Added smarter handling of bold/blink when applied to the default
	fg/bg colours:

	If the pixel value of fg/bg matches the pixel value of colour COLOR0
	through COLOR7, then applying bold/blink to the default fg/bg will
	select the appropriate colour from BOLD0 through BOLD7 instead of
	using the overstrike bold.

	This seems to be the best way to handle bold/blink attributes when
	the foreground/background match and ANSI colour anyhow.  For
	convenience, it is possible to use colour aliases (next item) for
	the foreground/background colours instead.

	My preference is a dull Canadian look:

		RXvt*foreground:	7
		RXvt*background:	10

    5.	Changed colour aliases (item 7 of last change) and dropped the `#'
	prefix.  This avoids confusion with the regular #rrggbb format of
	specifying colours and is unambiguous since there are no X11 colours
	starting with a digit.  This also avoids the need to quote the `#'
	to protect against shell interpretation.

    6.	Added colour cursor support.
	    -cr (cursorColor), as per XTerm -> the (rectangle) cursor colour
	    -cr2 (cursorColor2), only RXvt -> the text colour.

	The cursorColor2 maintains contrast in a colour environment and
	is optional.

	Thanks Raul Garcia Garcia <rgg@tid.es> for the idea.
	Cleaned up scr_refresh (again <sigh>) to avoid some unnecessary
	colour changes and removed the reverse video graphics context and
	just swap foreground/background colours instead.

    7.	Typo in command.c: had seteuid() instead of seteguid() <sigh>
	Use cfsetospeed()/cfsetispeed() for POSIX termios handling.

    8.	Ignore the loginShell option/resource for programs that DON'T end
	with "sh".  A hack but it keeps `rxvt -ls -e rlogin machine' from
	failing and I don't know of (m)any shells that don't end in "sh".

    9.	Hard-code dependencies in Makefiles to avoid using X11 makedepend.
	Added check for atexit() to catch the problem that exists on SunOS
	but not on Solaris.

   10.  Collected command-line option parsing and X11 resources into a
	single file (xdefaults.c), and introduced a monolithic structure
	(with bit-flags for logical options) to eliminate the massive
	if-else-if parsing and to reduce possible overlaps/oversights

	Short help provided for an incorrect argument.

	For more consistency, more flexibility, and fewer switches,
	made -grk4/-grk9 options obsolete, and replaced with `-grk mode'.
	Added the resource `greek_keyboard' while I was there.

	It is also possible to use a `--' or `++' prefix to get so-called
	`long options' that correspond to the resource name.
	For example,

		rxvt +ls -bg Blue
		rxvt +loginShell -background Blue
		rxvt ++loginShell --background Blue

		rxvt ++ls --bg Blue		Error!

   11.	Changed REFRESH_PERIOD to 1 in command.c, the old idea of providing
	for fast and furious scrolling needs to be reconsidered so that `cat'
	works.  Still needs some investigation.

   12.	Changed scr_poweron(), which corresponds to `ESC c', to also reset
	the scrollback buffer.

   13.	Changed scr_change_screen() (when compiled with NO_SECONDARY_SCREEN)
	so that switching from the secondary to primary screen will push the
	old secondary screen into the scrollback buffer.  This is fairly
	useful if your terminfo has have rmcup=\E[?47l\E8, smcup=\E7\E[?47h.
	It is NOT particularly useful if rmcup includes \E[2J, like some do.

	Running with NO_SECONDARY_SCREEN provides faster switching than
	with a real secondary screen and saves memory too.

   14.	Now that key values have mostly stabilized, moved the compile-time
	key choices to "feature.h" ("keys.h" now obsolete).

2.15 to 2.16
\-----------
    1.	Misc cleanup, rxvt once again passes the vttest (and reverse video
	works again).  Kanji support tested and seems to be okay.  Finally,
	an okay set of regular/bold colours.  Compile-time option for a
	right-side scrollbar.

    2.	Ctrl-minus now (correctly) generates ^_ [0x1F].
	Changed termcap/terminfo to use normal cursor keys instead of
	application cursor keys (rmkx/smkx, ke/ks) -- otherwise subsequent
	rxvt/xterm starts with the application cursor keys active.

    3.	Fixed scr_reset() so that resizing is a lot more sensible.
	Implemented the equivalent SouthWest resizeGravity (xterm X11R5) so
	the bottom line of text on the screen stays fixed.  If the window is
	made taller, additional saved lines will be scrolled down onto the
	screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be scrolled off
	the top of the screen, and the top saved lines will be dropped. The
	old resizing code is available with -DOLD_UGLY_RESIZE.

    4.	Altered code so all man-page documented command-line options will
	not trigger errors even if the feature wasn't compiled into rxvt.
	Added old, backward compatibility command-line options, but they're
	simply ignored. Eventually they can be removed -- perhaps Jan'97?

		`-8':		use `+7'
		`-fat':		use `-sb'
		`-thin':	use `-arrows'
		`-meta8thbit'	use `-meta8'
		`-metaescape'	use `-meta'
		`-font_list'	use `-font1', `-font2', etc.

	These ones are just too weird to support:

		`-ls-':		use `+ls'
		`-ma-':		use `+ma'

    5.	Removed secure-keyboard option, too problematic and obscure.

    6.	First attempt at GNU autoconfig.
	Still needs some work, but it's mostly okay.

    7.	Added minor aliases for foreground/background colours.  This permits
	colour specifications like -fg "#13" -bg "#10", which would set the
	foreground to colour 13 (bright yellow) and the background to colour
	10 (bright black).  It's not terribly useful yet, but might
	eventually be a nice way to have bold/blink colour work even on with
	the standard fg/bg colours.

2.14 to 2.15
\-----------
    1.	Small bug: initial width incorrect when there was no scrollBar.

    2.	Close the gaping security hole.  Renounce setuid/setgid privileges
	immediately and only take them up as needed -- chown() or writing
	into /etc/utmp.

    3.	Reverted to using `<' and '>' to toggle smaller/bigger fonts. It
	seems that many didn't like KP_Subtract/XK_KP_Add -- conflicts with
	some editors, and not all terminals have a Keypad anyhow.

    4.	Man page reformatted by Piercarlo Grandi <piercarl@sabi.demon.co.uk>
	so that it "now is done in the most delightful [sic] elegant 'roff
	style :-)"

    5.	Started to integrate the Kanji support based on old patches from the
	Linux-JE (Japanese Extensions) project.  Consider it alpha until one
	of the JE authors gives it a thorough check.

    6.	Added compile-time selection of a few different scrollbar widths.

    7.	When reading X resources, rxvt now recognizes two class names:
	"XTerm" and "RXvt".  The reason for two distinct names is that there
	are many options common between rxvt and xterm -- to which the class
	name "XTerm" permits easy access and configuration -- but there are
	also several options, notably colours and key-handling, unique to
	rxvt but which are useful to share between different rxvt
	configurations; the class name "RXvt" permits this.

	NB: The "RXvt" class takes precedence (in the event of a clash) and
	    is the only one ever used for the application defaults file.

    8.	The initial value used for the Backspace key (^H or ^?) is now
	determined from the value of CERASE used to set the termios
	structures.  This removes the need for the BACKSPACE_AS_DELETE
	compile-time option.

2.13 to 2.14
\-----------
    1.	Default HOTKEY prefix can now be choosen as `meta', `ctrl' or
	`shift'. Moved font toggle to KP_Add/KP_Subtract to resemble
	resolution toggling of the XFree86 server (Linux) and so that Alt-<
	can generate ESC-< for Emacs usage.  Man page and usage() reflect
	the changes. Note that if you choose the hotkey to be `shift', to
	mimic the Linux console scrollback, you'll probably want different
	keybindings for mapAlert and Secure.

	The choice of the HOTKEY (ctrl or meta) prefix and some of the
	key-strings can be compile-time defined in "rxvtkeys.h", although
	probably the only changes desired will be in the string value
	associated with XK_Delete and in the choice of a HOTKEY (ctrl or
	meta) prefix.

	Use shift or ctrl to temporarily toggle Backspace from ^H to ^?.
	Use shift to temporarily toggle the application keypad.

    2.	Patch so that setting bold or blink works before or after changing
	the colour (it used to only work before changing the colour). Also
	added the option of having DOS VGA colours.
	Thanks Avery Pennarun <apenwarr@foxnet.net>

    3.	Extensive reworking of pseudo-tty handling and addition of BSD sgtty
	terminal handling and new utmpx (Solaris 2.x) support. MANY thanks
	to Raul Garcia Garcia (rgg@tid.es).

	POSIX wtmp support added by Piet W. Plomp (piet@icce.rug.nl)

	Added -/+ut option (resource: utmpInhibit) so you can sometimes be
	harder to find :)

    4.	Finally? cleaned-up selection so that it works properly -- clears a
	previously selected region without causing a core dump -- define
	NEW_SELECTION.

	I believe that this should fix a long-standing problem with the
	selection mechanism -- probably back from when selection of the
	scrollback was added -- whereby all accounting was done in terms of
	screen row values [0 .. RxvtWin.rows-1] plus the current offset
	value.  The anchor and end points were scrolled with the screen, but
	the beginning point wasn't and extending a region that had its
	anchor scrolled-off would give complete garbage.  The new selection
	scheme has lots of bounds-checking (too much?) to prevent these
	problems.  If PRINT_PIPE is not defined, then you can use
	PrintScreen to dump some of the current selection state -- this
	should help debugging.

	Thanks to John Davis (davis@space.mit.edu) and Piet W. Plomp
	(piet@icce.rug.nl) for helping to diagnose the problem.

    5.	Use information request `ESC [ 8 n' to change the window title
	to the current rxvt version so you can find out what version you
	have.

    6.	Added simple code to permit run-time definition of the keysyms
	0xFF00 - 0xFFFF if KEYSYM_RESOURCE (for FAKE_RESOURCES only) is
	defined.  It's not as pretty as that used by xterm since it only
	works with keysym values rather that key names, but the impact on
	code size is quite minimal.  I use it in conjunction with `-name vm'
	to remap arrow and function keys for tn3270 ... quite handy.
	At the moment the string length is only limited by the line length
	(currently 256) used in "resources.c"

	The syntax (at the moment) is

		rxvt*keysym.0xFFnn:	"a string value"

	where `nn' is a 2 digit hex value 00 to FF.  Of course if there were
	an easy and small means of converting key names to keysym values,
	then that would be better.

	The enclosing quotes are required to start/end with whitespace.
	Most of the usual escape values can be used:

		\b - backspace
		\e - escape
		\n - newline
		\r - carriage return
		\t - tab
		\000 - octal number

	Anyhow, here's a brief example of what it looks like
	in ~/.Xdefaults:

	! F11 key - mimic the output of F1
	rxvt*keysym.0xFFC8: \e[11~

	! F12 key - whatever
	rxvt*keysym.0xFFC9: Hello World!\n"\"String\" ends with whitespace  "

	! Delete key - remap
	rxvt*keysym.0xFFFF: "Delete :)"

	!Scroll_Lock as flow-control (^S)
	rxvt*keysym.0xFF14: \023

    7.	Oops -- fixed resource name from scrollbar to scrollBar. Fixed
	cursor colours to black on white (like xterm) for the scrollbar
	cursors, but I've left the xterm (`I'-bar) cursor as foreground on
	background because it looks so nice.  Allocate all colours when
	creating the window so that we don't have to worry about it later
	and so that we can avoid potential hassles with colour-hungry
	applications like Netscape.

    8.  Added a way to distinguish an rxvt from an xterm via the obsolete
	ESC Z sending the vt100 answer string with 'c' -> 'C'.

	Added support for resolving the actual IP number of the host for
	remote DISPLAYs.  Changed the answer back for ESC[7n to add a
	trailing newline to support easier input into the shell.  When the
	display is local (i.e. :0), we add support for sending the first
	non-loopback interface IP number as the DISPLAY instead of just
	sending the incorrect ":0".  This way telnet/rlogin shells can
	actually get the correct information into DISPLAY for xclients.

	[Note: I've not had a chance to thoroughly test this -- mjo]

2.12 to 2.13
\-----------
    1.	Shift and Control now only work for non-application mode cursor
	keys and with function keys.

    2.	Override XTerm mouse reporting with either Mod1 or Shift.  X11
	mouse reporting now properly includes modifier keys (see rxvt.ref).
	Although this effectively degenerates to the Control modifier alone
	since both Shift and Meta are used to temporarily disable mouse
	reporting -- I don't know an easy way around this but that's what
	XTerm does, although since it uses Control to pop-up menus, that
	doesn't get transmitted either.

    3.  Moved a few more configuration items from Imakefile to configure.h

    4.	Added XAPPLOADDIR define to the Imakefile to allow use of the
	application defaults file XAPPLOADDIR/RXvt when rxvt has been
	compiled with FAKE_RESOURCES.  Now, the following files are
	checked:
		XAPPLOADDIR/RXvt	(compile-time defined)
		$HOME/.Xdefaults or $HOME/.Xresources
	suggested by John Gotts <jgotts@engin.umich.edu>

    5.	Applied patches by Edward D.H. Liu <dhliu@solar.csie.ntu.edu.tw>
	to fix the speed of pasting rxvt's selection to motif, xew or tk.
	Finally! reasonable pasting speed to these applications.

    6.	patches by Gregory Margo <gmargo@newton.vip.best.com>
	for xterm-style proportional scrollbar behaviour:
		If pointer is near top, scroll one line.
		If pointer is near bottom, scroll full page.
	refreshPeriod resource and -refresh option ... still wishing
	for faster screen refreshing.

    7.	Bug fix for partial matches (FAKE_RESOURCES).  In addition to
	resources for resource name `rxvt', also get resources for class
	name `XTerm' as well.  Remove checking for `command' resource since
	it's not found in xterm nor was there any code in place to parse the
	command arguments ... better just to use the command-line -e option.
	Replace `fontList' with font1, font2, ... etc. for better xterm
	compatibility and for ease of configuration.  Changed processing of
	string resources and command-line string options to avoid allocating
	redundant memory.

    8.	Previously selected region is now properly cleared when Button1 is
	pressed.  Still have problems with click-and-drag when Mod1 or Shift
	is used to override mouse reporting -- argh!  Until someone gets
	this properly patched, use Button1 followed by Button3 (to extend
	region) in these instances.

    9.	Understands ANSI set default fg/bg colour (\E[39m / \E[49m)

   10.	In the screen accounting used in screen.c, use a '\n' to terminate
	wrapped lines instead of '\0'.  This should avoid mouse selection of
	wrapped lines from including a bogus newline.  No known
	side-effects, but changes isolated by #define NEW_WRAPTYPE.

2.11 to 2.12
\-----------
    1.	Extra functionality for XTerm mouse report mode.  If mouse reporting
	is enabled (the application will handle mouse events) the normal
	scrollbar operation is disabled -- instead rxvt sends UP/DOWN for
	the arrow buttons and PageUp/PageDown when Button1 or Button3 are
	clicked on the scrollbar.  Use Mod1 (Alt) key to get the normal
	scrollbar/arrow button actions and also to get the normal selection
	functions -- so that you can still cut/paste between X applications.

    2.	New colour possibilities -- 16 colours.  Instead of using fatter
	characters, a bold attribute now uses a brighter foreground colour.
	Similarly, a blink attribute will use a brighter background colour.
	It is also possible to choose these colours through the resources
	(color0 -- color7) permit specification of the ANSI colours (black,
	red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white), the resources
	(color10 -- color17) are the brighter bold/blink equivalents.
	Define USE_FAKE_BOLD to disable.

    3.	Extensive clean-up of source and headers to separate
	interdependencies, remove unused variables.  Introduced static
	variables wherever possible to limit scoping and reduced the number
	of external variables.

    4.	Allow NumLock to toggle on/off the application keypad.

	Backspace sends '\b', Ctrl-Backspace sends '\177'.
	Define BACKSPACE_AS_DELETE to reverse these values or use the
	escape sequence:

		ESC [ 36 h		Backspace key sends BS
		ESC [ 36 l		Backspace key sends DEL

	XK_End used to send "\033Ow", which is identical to XK_KP_7 and
	confuses EDT-type editors. Now,
	Home = "\033[7~"
	End  = "\033[8~"

	Changed Alert & Secure keys from Alt-i & Alt-s to Alt-I & Alt-S so
	they aren't so easily toggled.

    5.	Extra keystroke info.  Pass Control and Shift indicators for
	function keys (similar to the XJed editor)
	eg,
		F1	= ESC [11~
		C-F1	= ESC [11^
		S-F1	= ESC [11$

	also, pass indication of shift status for arrow-keys
	eg,
		Up, Down, Right, Left
		  = ESC [A, ESC [B, ESC [C, ESC [D
		S-Up, S-Down, S-Right, S-Left
		  = ESC [a, ESC [b, ESC [c, ESC [d

	You wouldn't be able to use these keys for termcap/terminfo
	applications, but the key sequences are available for remapping
	within an application.

    6.	Added configure.h which is included by each source file and by the
	Imakefile.  Common compilation defines are now all contained in
	configure.h with minor system defines remaining in Imakefile --
	makes it much easier to configure.  Used XCOMM macro in Imakefile so
	that it actually works.  Also added defaults.h for defining
	user-specific startup defaults.

    7.	Added rxvt.ref to provide documentation of the various terminal
	sequences that are processed.  Updated man page to reflect changes.

    8.	Use xterm-style -/+ to turn on/off options, rationalized resource
	names to more closely resemble xterm.

		Option			Resource
		-help			-
		-display displayname	-
		-geometry geom		geometry:
		-bg color		background:
		-fg color		foreground:
          	-color<n> color		color<n>: <string>
					where <n> = [0-7], 1[0-7]
		-fn fontname		font: <string>

		-prkey keysym		printscreen_key: <string>
          				greektoggle_key: <string>
          				cutchars: <string>

    9.	Fixed Button actions for XTerm-style scrollbar so that Button1 and
	Button3 do different things as they are supposed to.  Replace -/+fat
	with -/+sb and -/+arrows for more consistency with XTerm. Decreased
	width of `fat' scrollbar (make closer to xterm) and increased width
	of `thin' scrollbar (arrows too small) -- they are now the same
	width.  Also made it possible to remove the scrollbar altogether.
	Added a visual bell.

	Added many more defines to further reduce code size for various
	cases, see "configure.h".  It is also possible to alter settings in
	"defaults.h" for configuration options that will only affect
	screen.c and xsetup.c, this should help with compile-time
	customization for those who don't want to use Xdefaults.

	Added the define REPLACE_SELECTION_NEWLINE to make the substitution
	of newlines with carriage returns for selection pasting a
	compile-time option.

   10.	Fixed the graphics samples so that if you want to it's actually
	possible to compile them.  Added -name command-line option so that
	it's possible to select different sets of resources.

   11.  Integrated initial support for X11 mouse reporting and added
	Shift + Function Keys support.

2.10 to 2.11
    1.	If NEW_COLOR_MODEL is defined in screen.c, the new model I described
	in an earlier email is used. (apparantly there are two, slightly
	differnt models for using color extensions in a vt-compatible
	terminal. This flag lets you switch.

    2.	If XTERM_MOUSE_REPORT is defined in command.c, mouse reporting is
	turned on/off via the appropriate escape sequences.  XTerm already
	provides this support.

    3.	If .Xdefaults does not exist, .Xresources is searched for.  It seems
	that many here use .Xresources.

2.09 to 2.10
    1.	Really fixed the color problem (?) Got color-ls, and it works now.
    2.	Added patch to allow run-time selection of font list.

2.07 to 2.09
    1.	Fixed some color-usage errors.
    2.	Added double and triple-click support
	compliments of ah@doc.ic.ac.uk (Angelo Haritsis)
    3.	Added Print Screen capability, as in most vt-100's
2.06 to 2.07
    1.	Fixed problems with rxvt screwing up tty permisssions (?)
2.03 to 2.06
    1.	Fixed a limit which imposed a maximum width for the
	terminal window of 255 characters. There is no limit now.
    2.	Made provision for applications to get mouse-click feedback
	when user clicks in a graphics window. See graphics_sample
2.02 to 2.03
    1.	Fixed memory management just a little.

2.0 to 2.02
    1.	Bug fixes for color and graphics.

1.97 to 2.0
    1.	Added ANSI color support. Compile with -DCOLOR
    2.	Added a graphics mode. Compile with -DGRAPHICS
1.96 to 1.97
    1.	Bug in refresh() which was causing slow refreshes after
	clear-screens was fixed. Showed up during emacs start-up.

1.95 to 1.96
    1.	rxvt did bad things if it received mouse - Motion events
	without a preceeding button-press. Fixed.
1.94 to 1.95
    1.	Created a substitute for XGetDefaults, which seemed to account for
	1/2 to 2/3 of the memory used by rxvt (according to the SIZE field
	of ps output). My substitute only reads the .Xdefaults file. Compile
	with -DFAKE_RESOURCES to get my mini- XDefaults handling,
	-DREAL_RESOURCES to keep XGetDefault.

1.93 to 1.94
    1.	Fixed some minor long-standing errors in the vt100 emulation.
    2.	Fixed ALT-<char> handling in command.c
    3.	Fixed minor bug with start-of-selection location.
    4.	Added xterm-type "extend selection" feature using
	mouse button 3. Button 1 always starts a new selection. Button3
	tries to extend the current selection if possible.
    5.	Fixed problem with bold-face fonts overflowing into
    	the next character for some fonts.

1.92 to 1.93
    1.	ran gprof to find bottle-necks in the code. Halved user
	time, but had little effect on total time required to
	update the display. Seems worth keeping for the more efficient
	user-time, though. At this point, I think that most of the elapsed
	time is spent waiting for input or waiting for the X buffers
	to flush.
    2.	Used to refresh the screen every 2.2 screen-fulls during
	flat-out scrolling. Really cuts down on scroll-time. Now,
	refresh every screen-full (or when there's a pause in activity),
	but when flat-out scrolling starts, decrease the refresh period,
	so that its every 10th screenful after a little while. This has
	no noticeable visible effect, since the scrolling text is
	absolutely unintelligible anyway, but will improve the scroll
	"feel" when doing just one or two screenfulls, ie in an ls -l.
    3.	Surrounded  the code which uses XCopyArea with #ifdef's
	I have never seen this help performance, but I think that there
	may be some video-systems which benefit from this, particularly
	in a full-screen editor or slow scrolling type of setting.
    4.	Performance in flat out scrolling, text only, on a sparc-10,
	displaying rxvt on an HDS x-terminal:
	  nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time rxvt -e cat k
		6.1 real         3.1 user         2.5 sys
	  nation@snoopy>/usr/bin/time xterm -e cat k
		40.8 real         4.6 user         3.4 sys

1.91 to 1.92
    1.	Added greek-keyboard support patches.
1.85 to 1.91
    1.	assorted minor patches
1.82 to 1.85
    1.	Fixed ESC c handling.
    2.	Fixed minor selection handling bug.

1.81 to 1.82
    1.	Fixed slow refresh during selection process
    2.	Fixed problem of not correctly clearing selections of 1 character.

1.80 to 1.81
    1.	Fixed some scrolling problems, problems with partially obscured
	windows.
    2.	Added some neat debugging capability in debug.c
    3.	Patched up rclock.

1.74 to 1.80
    1.	Fixed core dump from selecting past the bottom of the screen
    2.	Fixed a few escape sequences, per the vttest program
    3.	Broke and fixed handling of moved/resize/new-font handling.
    4.	Still can't change tab stops correctly.
    5.	Ran vt-100 test suite. Added capability to change tab stops
	and enter reverse video, and to switch from 80 to 132
	columns and back. Fixed a seg-fault in scroll().

1.70 to 1.74
    1.	Fixed cursor drawing errors.
    2.	Improved smoothness of scroll-back operations.
    3.	Applied some SVR4 patches.
    4.	Applied HPUX patches, and a few cursor display patches
    5.	Fixed up font-changing routines a bit.
    6.	Fixed a scrolling problem for windows taller than the scroll-back
	buffer.

1.6 to 1.7
    1.	Fixed the problem with random rendition flags in the scroll
	back buffer
    2.	Fiddled with re-drawing on the scroll-bar, and with
	how often refreshing occurs.
    3.	Incorporated some AIX patches.
    4.	Included #ifdef'd changes to support vt100 printer.
    5.	Fixed send_string routine, so that it doesn't loose
	data.
    6.	Complete re-write of screen.c
1.5 to 1.6
    1.	Removed all use of a seperate bold font. Now uses
	over-striking exclusively.
    2.	Added some more optimizations for drawing speed when
	the window is re-sized or moved.
    3.	Implemented speed ups in screen.c

1.47 to 1.48
    1.	Cleaned up re-drawing on expose events, so rxvt only
	re-draws the newly exposed parts of the screen.
    2.	Fixed backspace, which must have broken in 1.45.
    3.	Added command line option of iconic startup.

from 1.45 to 1.47
    1.	Incorporated improved bsd utmp handling from
        dperry@ringer.cs.utsa.edu (David Perry)
    2.	Fixed a very minor bug where the solid-cursor can leave a
    	a bit of a ghost when you resize the window. Its stupid,
	but it always bothered me.

from 1.4 to 1.45
    1.	Fixed scrolling error when switching to larger fonts
    2.	Fixed utmp-entry removal for SYSV type systems.
    3.	Icorportated patches for FreeBSD and svr4
