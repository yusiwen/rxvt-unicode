CONFIGURE OPTIONS
    General hint: if you get compile errors, then likely your configuration
    hasn't been tested well. Either try with "--enable-everything" or use
    the ./reconf script as a base for experiments. ./reconf is used by
    myself, so it should generally be a working config. Of course, you
    should always report when a combination doesn't work, so it can be
    fixed. Marc Lehmann <rxvt@schmorp.de>.

    All

    --enable-everything
        Add (or remove) support for all non-multichoice options listed in
        "./configure --help".

        You can specify this and then disable options you do not like by
        *following* this with the appropriate "--disable-..." arguments, or
        you can start with a minimal configuration by specifying
        "--disable-everything" and than adding just the "--enable-..."
        arguments you want.

    --enable-xft (default: enabled)
        Add support for Xft (anti-aliases, among others) fonts. Xft fonts
        are slower and require lots of memory, but as long as you don't use
        them, you don't pay for them.

    --enable-font-styles (default: on)
        Add support for bold, *italic* and *bold italic* font styles. The
        fonts can be set manually or automatically.

    --with-codesets=NAME,... (default: all)
        Compile in support for additional codeset (encoding) groups ("eu",
        "vn" are always compiled in, which includes most 8-bit character
        sets). These codeset tables are used for driving X11 core fonts,
        they are not required for Xft fonts, although having them compiled
        in lets rxvt-unicode choose replacement fonts more intelligently.
        Compiling them in will make your binary bigger (all of together cost
        about 700kB), but it doesn't increase memory usage unless you use a
        font requiring one of these encodings.

   all             all available codeset groups 
   zh              common chinese encodings 
   zh_ext          rarely used but very big chinese encodigs 
   jp              common japanese encodings 
   jp_ext          rarely used but big japanese encodings 
   kr              korean encodings 
    --enable-xim (default: on)
        Add support for XIM (X Input Method) protocol. This allows using
        alternative input methods (e.g. kinput2) and will also correctly set
        up the input for people using dead keys or compose keys.

    --enable-unicode3 (default: off)
        Recommended to stay off unless you really need non-BMP characters.

        Enable direct support for displaying unicode codepoints above 65535
        (the basic multilingual page). This increases storage requirements
        per character from 2 to 4 bytes. X11 fonts do not yet support these
        extra characters, but Xft does.

        Please note that rxvt-unicode can store unicode code points >65535
        even without this flag, but the number of such characters is limited
        to a view thousand (shared with combining characters, see next
        switch), and right now rxvt-unicode cannot display them
        (input/output and cut&paste still work, though).

    --enable-combining (default: on)
        Enable automatic composition of combining characters into composite
        characters. This is required for proper viewing of text where
        accents are encoded as seperate unicode characters. This is done by
        using precomposited characters when available or creating new
        pseudo-characters when no precomposed form exists.

        Without --enable-unicode3, the number of additional precomposed
        characters is somewhat limited (the 6400 private use characters will
        be (ab-)used). With --enable-unicode3, no practical limit exists.

        This option will also enable storage (but not display) of characters
        beyond plane 0 (>65535) when --enable-unicode3 was not specified.

        The combining table also contains entries for arabic presentation
        forms, but these are not currently used. Bug me if you want these to
        be used (and tell me how these are to be used...).

    --enable-fallback(=CLASS) (default: Rxvt)
        When reading resource settings, also read settings for class CLASS.
        To disable resource fallback use --disable-fallback.

    --with-res-name=NAME (default: urxvt)
        Use the given name as default application name when reading
        resources. Specify --with-res-name=rxvt to replace rxvt.

    --with-res-class=CLASS /default: URxvt)
        Use the given class as default application class when reading
        resources. Specify --with-res-class=Rxvt to replace rxvt.

    --enable-utmp (default: on)
        Write user and tty to utmp file (used by programs like w) at start
        of rxvt execution and delete information when rxvt exits.

    --enable-wtmp (default: on)
        Write user and tty to wtmp file (used by programs like last) at
        start of rxvt execution and write logout when rxvt exits. This
        option requires --enable-utmp to also be specified.

    --enable-lastlog (default: on)
        Write user and tty to lastlog file (used by programs like lastlogin)
        at start of rxvt execution. This option requires --enable-utmp to
        also be specified.

    --enable-xpm-background (default: on)
        Add support for XPM background pixmaps.

    --enable-transparency (default: on)
        Add support for inheriting parent backgrounds thus giving a fake
        transparency to the term.

    --enable-fading (default: on)
        Add support for fading the text when focus is lost (requires
        "--enable-transparency").

    --enable-tinting (default: on)
        Add support for tinting of transparent backgrounds (requires
        "--enable-transparency").

    --enable-rxvt-scroll (default: on)
        Add support for the original rxvt scrollbar.

    --enable-next-scroll (default: on)
        Add support for a NeXT-like scrollbar.

    --enable-xterm-scroll (default: on)
        Add support for an Xterm-like scrollbar.

    --enable-plain-scroll (default: on)
        Add support for a very unobtrusive, plain-looking scrollbar that is
        the favourite of the rxvt-unicode author, having used it for many
        years.

    --enable-ttygid (default: off)
        Change tty device setting to group "tty" - only use this if your
        system uses this type of security.

    --disable-backspace-key
        Removes any handling of the backspace key by us - let the X server
        do it.

    --disable-delete-key
        Removes any handling of the delete key by us - let the X server do
        it.

    --disable-resources
        Removes any support for resource checking.

    --disable-swapscreen
        Remove support for secondary/swap screen.

    --enable-frills (default: on)
        Add support for many small features that are not essential but nice
        to have. Normally you want this, but for very small binaries you may
        want to disable this.

        A non-exhaustive list of features enabled by "--enable-frills"
        (possibly in combination with other switches) is:

          MWM-hints
          EWMH-hints (pid, utf8 names) and protocols (ping)
          seperate underline colour (-underlineColor)
          settable border widths and borderless switch (-w, -b, -bl)
          visual depth selection (-depth)
          settable extra linespacing /-lsp)
          iso-14755-2 and -3, and visual feedback
          tripleclickwords (-tcw)
          settable insecure mode (-insecure)
          keysym remapping support
          cursor blinking and underline cursor (-cb, -uc)
          XEmbed support (-embed)
          user-pty (-pty-fd)
          hold on exit (-hold)
          skip builtin block graphics (-sbg)
          separate highlightcolor support (-hc)

        It also enables some non-essential features otherwise disabled, such
        as:

          some round-trip time optimisations
          nearest color allocation on pseudocolor screens
          UTF8_STRING supporr for selection
          sgr modes 90..97 and 100..107
          backindex and forwardindex escape sequences
          view change/zero scorllback esacpe sequences
          locale switching escape sequence
          window op and some xterm/OSC escape sequences
          rectangular selections
          trailing space removal for selections
          verbose X error handling

    --enable-iso14755 (default: on)
        Enable extended ISO 14755 support (see rxvt(1), or doc/rxvt.1.txt).
        Basic support (section 5.1) is enabled by "--enable-frills", while
        support for 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 is enabled with this switch.

    --enable-keepscrolling (default: on)
        Add support for continual scrolling of the display when you hold the
        mouse button down on a scrollbar arrow.

    --enable-mousewheel (default: on)
        Add support for scrolling via mouse wheel or buttons 4 & 5.

    --enable-slipwheeling (default: on)
        Add support for continual scrolling (using the mouse wheel as an
        accelerator) while the control key is held down. This option
        requires --enable-mousewheel to also be specified.

    --disable-new-selection
        Remove support for mouse selection style like that of xterm.

    --enable-dmalloc (default: off)
        Use Gray Watson's malloc - which is good for debugging See
        <http://www.letters.com/dmalloc/> for details If you use either this
        or the next option, you may need to edit src/Makefile after
        compiling to point DINCLUDE and DLIB to the right places.

        You can only use either this option and the following (should you
        use either) .

    --enable-dlmalloc (default: off)
        Use Doug Lea's malloc - which is good for a production version See
        <http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html> for details.

    --enable-smart-resize (default: on)
        Add smart growth/shrink behaviour when changing font size via hot
        keys. This should keep the window corner which is closest to a
        corner of the screen in a fixed position.

    --enable-pointer-blank (default: on)
        Add support to have the pointer disappear when typing or inactive.

    --enable-perl (default: on)
        Enable an embedded perl interpreter. See the rxvtperl(3) manpage
        (doc/rxvtperl.txt) for more info on this feature, or the files in
        src/perl-ext/ for the extensions that are installed by default. The
        perl interpreter that is used can be specified via the "PERL"
        environment variable when running configure.

    --with-name=NAME (default: urxvt)
        Set the basename for the installed binaries, resulting in "urxvt",
        "urxvtd" etc.). Specify "--with-name=rxvt" to replace with "rxvt".

    --with-term=NAME (default: rxvt-unicode)
        Change the environmental variable for the terminal to NAME.

    --with-terminfo=PATH
        Change the environmental variable for the path to the terminfo tree
        to PATH.

    --with-x
        Use the X Window System (pretty much default, eh?).

    --with-xpm-includes=DIR
        Look for the XPM includes in DIR.

    --with-xpm-library=DIR
        Look for the XPM library in DIR.

    --with-xpm
        Not needed - define via --enable-xpm-background.
