CONFIGURE OPTIONS
    General hint: if you get compile errors, then likely your configuration
    hasn't been tested well. Either try with "--enable-everything" or use
    the default configuration (i.e. no "--enable-xxx" or "--disable-xxx"
    switches). Of course, you should always report when a combination
    doesn't work, so it can be fixed. Marc Lehmann <rxvt@schmorp.de>.

    All

    --enable-everything
        Add (or remove) support for all non-multichoice options listed in
        "./configure --help", except for "--enable-assert" and
        "--enable-256-color".

        You can specify this and then disable options you do not like by
        *following* this with the appropriate "--disable-..." arguments, or
        you can start with a minimal configuration by specifying
        "--disable-everything" and than adding just the "--enable-..."
        arguments you want.

    --enable-xft (default: on)
        Add support for Xft (anti-aliased, among others) fonts. Xft fonts
        are slower and require lots of memory, but as long as you don't use
        them, you don't pay for them.

    --enable-font-styles (default: on)
        Add support for bold, *italic* and *bold italic* font styles. The
        fonts can be set manually or automatically.

    --with-codesets=CS,... (default: all)
        Compile in support for additional codeset (encoding) groups ("eu",
        "vn" are always compiled in, which includes most 8-bit character
        sets). These codeset tables are used for driving X11 core fonts,
        they are not required for Xft fonts, although having them compiled
        in lets rxvt-unicode choose replacement fonts more intelligently.
        Compiling them in will make your binary bigger (all of together cost
        about 700kB), but it doesn't increase memory usage unless you use a
        font requiring one of these encodings.

   all             all available codeset groups 
   zh              common chinese encodings 
   zh_ext          rarely used but very big chinese encodings 
   jp              common japanese encodings 
   jp_ext          rarely used but big japanese encodings 
   kr              korean encodings 
    --enable-xim (default: on)
        Add support for XIM (X Input Method) protocol. This allows using
        alternative input methods (e.g. kinput2) and will also correctly set
        up the input for people using dead keys or compose keys.

    --enable-unicode3 (default: off)
        Recommended to stay off unless you really need non-BMP characters.

        Enable direct support for displaying unicode codepoints above 65535
        (the basic multilingual page). This increases storage requirements
        per character from 2 to 4 bytes. X11 fonts do not yet support these
        extra characters, but Xft does.

        Please note that rxvt-unicode can store unicode code points >65535
        even without this flag, but the number of such characters is limited
        to a few thousand (shared with combining characters, see next
        switch), and right now rxvt-unicode cannot display them
        (input/output and cut&paste still work, though).

    --enable-combining (default: on)
        Enable automatic composition of combining characters into composite
        characters. This is required for proper viewing of text where
        accents are encoded as separate unicode characters. This is done by
        using precomposed characters when available or creating new
        pseudo-characters when no precomposed form exists.

        Without --enable-unicode3, the number of additional precomposed
        characters is somewhat limited (the 6400 private use characters will
        be (ab-)used). With --enable-unicode3, no practical limit exists.

        This option will also enable storage (but not display) of characters
        beyond plane 0 (>65535) when --enable-unicode3 was not specified.

        The combining table also contains entries for arabic presentation
        forms, but these are not currently used. Bug me if you want these to
        be used (and tell me how these are to be used...).

    --enable-fallback[=CLASS] (default: Rxvt)
        When reading resource settings, also read settings for class CLASS.
        To disable resource fallback use --disable-fallback.

    --with-res-name=NAME (default: urxvt)
        Use the given name as default application name when reading
        resources. Specify --with-res-name=rxvt to replace rxvt.

    --with-res-class=CLASS (default: URxvt)
        Use the given class as default application class when reading
        resources. Specify --with-res-class=Rxvt to replace rxvt.

    --enable-utmp (default: on)
        Write user and tty to utmp file (used by programs like w) at start
        of rxvt execution and delete information when rxvt exits.

    --enable-wtmp (default: on)
        Write user and tty to wtmp file (used by programs like last) at
        start of rxvt execution and write logout when rxvt exits. This
        option requires --enable-utmp to also be specified.

    --enable-lastlog (default: on)
        Write user and tty to lastlog file (used by programs like lastlogin)
        at start of rxvt execution. This option requires --enable-utmp to
        also be specified.

    --enable-afterimage (default: on)
        Add support for libAfterImage to be used for background images. It
        adds support for many file formats including JPG, PNG, SVG, TIFF,
        GIF, XPM, BMP, ICO, XCF, TGA and AfterStep image XML
        (<http://www.afterstep.org/visualdoc.php?show=asimagexml>).

        Note that with this option enabled, rxvt's memory footprint might
        increase by a few megabytes even if no extra features are used
        (mostly due to third-party libraries used by libAI). Memory
        footprint may somewhat be lowered if libAfterImage is configured
        without support for SVG.

    --enable-pixbuf (default: on)
        Add support for GDK-PixBuf to be used for background images. It adds
        support for many file formats including JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, XPM,
        BMP, ICO and TGA.

    --enable-transparency (default: on)
        Add support for using the root pixmap as background to simulate
        transparency. Note that blur and blend effects depend on
        libAfterImage or on libXrender and on the availability of the RENDER
        extension in the X server.

    --enable-fading (default: on)
        Add support for fading the text when focus is lost.

    --enable-rxvt-scroll (default: on)
        Add support for the original rxvt scrollbar.

    --enable-next-scroll (default: on)
        Add support for a NeXT-like scrollbar.

    --enable-xterm-scroll (default: on)
        Add support for an Xterm-like scrollbar.

    --disable-backspace-key
        Removes any handling of the backspace key by us - let the X server
        do it.

    --disable-delete-key
        Removes any handling of the delete key by us - let the X server do
        it.

    --disable-resources
        Removes any support for resource checking.

    --disable-swapscreen
        Remove support for secondary/swap screen.

    --enable-frills (default: on)
        Add support for many small features that are not essential but nice
        to have. Normally you want this, but for very small binaries you may
        want to disable this.

        A non-exhaustive list of features enabled by "--enable-frills"
        (possibly in combination with other switches) is:

          MWM-hints
          EWMH-hints (pid, utf8 names) and protocols (ping)
          urgency hint
          separate underline colour (-underlineColor)
          settable border widths and borderless switch (-w, -b, -bl)
          visual depth selection (-depth)
          settable extra linespacing (-lsp)
          iso-14755 5.1 (basic) support
          tripleclickwords (-tcw)
          settable insecure mode (-insecure)
          keysym remapping support
          cursor blinking and underline cursor (-bc, -uc)
          XEmbed support (-embed)
          user-pty (-pty-fd)
          hold on exit (-hold)
          compile in built-in block graphics
          skip builtin block graphics (-sbg)
          separate highlight colour (-highlightColor, -highlightTextColor)
          extended mouse reporting modes (1005 and 1015).

        It also enables some non-essential features otherwise disabled, such
        as:

          some round-trip time optimisations
          nearest colour allocation on pseudocolor screens
          UTF8_STRING support for selection
          sgr modes 90..97 and 100..107
          backindex and forwardindex escape sequences
          view change/zero scrollback escape sequences
          locale switching escape sequence
          window op and some xterm/OSC escape sequences
          rectangular selections
          trailing space removal for selections
          verbose X error handling

    --enable-iso14755 (default: on)
        Enable extended ISO 14755 support (see rxvt(1)). Basic support
        (section 5.1) is enabled by "--enable-frills", while support for
        5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 is enabled with this switch.

    --enable-keepscrolling (default: on)
        Add support for continual scrolling of the display when you hold the
        mouse button down on a scrollbar arrow.

    --enable-selectionscrolling (default: on)
        Add support for scrolling when the selection moves to the top or
        bottom of the screen.

    --enable-mousewheel (default: on)
        Add support for scrolling via mouse wheel or buttons 4 & 5.

    --enable-slipwheeling (default: on)
        Add support for continual scrolling (using the mouse wheel as an
        accelerator) while the control key is held down. This option
        requires --enable-mousewheel to also be specified.

    --enable-smart-resize (default: off)
        Add smart growth/shrink behaviour when resizing. This should keep
        the window corner which is closest to a corner of the screen in a
        fixed position.

    --enable-text-blink (default: on)
        Add support for blinking text.

    --enable-pointer-blank (default: on)
        Add support to have the pointer disappear when typing or inactive.

    --enable-perl (default: on)
        Enable an embedded perl interpreter. See the rxvtperl(3) manpage for
        more info on this feature, or the files in src/perl/ for the
        extensions that are installed by default. The perl interpreter that
        is used can be specified via the "PERL" environment variable when
        running configure. Even when compiled in, perl will *not* be
        initialised when all extensions have been disabled "-pe ""
        --perl-ext-common """, so it should be safe to enable from a
        resource standpoint.

    --enable-assert (default: off)
        Enables the assertions in the code, normally disabled. This switch
        is only useful when developing rxvt-unicode.

    --enable-256-color (default: off)
        Force use of so-called 256 colour mode, to work around buggy
        applications that do not support termcap/terminfo, or simply improve
        support for applications hardcoding the xterm 256 colour table.

        This switch breaks termcap/terminfo compatibility to
        "TERM=rxvt-unicode", and consequently sets "TERM" to
        "rxvt-unicode-256color" by default (doc/etc/ contains
        termcap/terminfo definitions for both).

        It also results in higher memory usage and can slow down rxvt
        dramatically when more than six fonts are in use by a terminal
        instance.

    --with-afterimage-config=DIR
        Look for the libAfterImage config script in DIR.

    --with-name=NAME (default: urxvt)
        Set the basename for the installed binaries, resulting in "urxvt",
        "urxvtd" etc.). Specify "--with-name=rxvt" to replace with "rxvt".

    --with-term=NAME (default: rxvt-unicode)
        Change the environmental variable for the terminal to NAME.

    --with-terminfo=PATH
        Change the environmental variable for the path to the terminfo tree
        to PATH.

    --with-x
        Use the X Window System (pretty much default, eh?).
