/*
 * ESC-Z processing:
 *
 * By stealing a sequence to which other xterms respond, and sending the
 * same number of characters, but having a distinguishable sequence,
 * we can avoid having a timeout (when not under an rxvt) for every login
 * shell to auto-set its DISPLAY.
 *
 * This particular sequence is even explicitly stated as obsolete since
 * about 1985, so only very old software is likely to be confused, a
 * confusion which can likely be remedied through termcap or TERM. Frankly,
 * I doubt anyone will even notice.  We provide a #ifdef just in case they
 * don't care about auto-display setting.  Just in case the ancient
 * software in question is broken enough to be case insensitive to the 'c'
 * character in the answerback string, we make the distinguishing
 * characteristic be capitalization of that character. The length of the
 * two strings should be the same so that identical read (2) calls may be
 * used.
